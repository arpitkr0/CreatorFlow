with the significant steps Russia has taken to strengthen its air power the development of the Russian aerospace forces has reached a crucial new stage In a report published by Ria Nosti and sourced from official statements by Rosstec's press service it was revealed that by 2025 the Russian Aerospace Forces had received the first batch of newly produced multi-roll SU35s fighter jets manufactured by the United Aircraft Corporation part of Rosstec a state-owned company playing a vital role in the development of Russia's defense technology These four plus generation fighter jets are not just additional equipment but rather a symbol of significant progress in Russia's military capabilities The SU35S has successfully passed the entire factory testing cycle and has been accepted by technical staff who will maintain and operate it Furthermore the aircraft has undergone a series of trials in various operational modes conducted by pilots from the Russian Ministry of Defense ensuring that it is ready to face the challenges of modern battlefields Russia is clearly not half-hearted in developing its air capabilities The manufacturers who are also part of the national defense industry complex have seriously fulfilled their duty to ensure the supply of the latest and most advanced aviation equipment for the armed forces In this regard the SU35S is not just an ordinary fighter jet but a bridge that marks the transition towards a more advanced fifth generation aviation system How has it managed to convince the Russian aerospace forces keep your eyes on the story Before we dive deeper into the details of this fighter jet and why it is often referred to as a bridge to the fifth generation let's take a moment to observe its role in the skies where important missions often depend on its resilience For example in a combat alert mission in the Korsk region the SU35S fighter jet played a vital role in protecting ground attack aircraft bombers and helicopters operating in the area Its presence was always on standby ready to move at a moment's notice during critical times At one point when two long range TU95MS bombers carried out a planned flight over neutral waters of the Sea of Okatsk and the Sea of Japan with a flight duration of more than 8 hours The SU35S along with SU30SM jets from the Russian Air Force closely escorted the bombers throughout their journey Now let's take a closer look at what the SU35S has to offer given its remarkable capabilities in the vast skies Russia recognizes the great potential of its fighter jets which is why the United Aircraft Corporation has taken significant steps to enhance the production capacity of its advanced aircraft In this grand plan the focus is on the production of fighter jets such as the SU35S SU34 and SU57 This capacity expansion process involves the development of facilities at aircraft plants in Kamsaq on Amore and Novosabersk which are currently being expanded Not only are the facilities being improved but staff training and upgrading production equipment are also key priorities to address any potential challenges and ensure smooth production Behind these efforts the SU35S a product of Russia's skilled craftsmanship draws attention once again The SU35S is designed to offer a combination of exceptional maneuverability long range strike capabilities and next generation avionics This aircraft is part of a larger plan to modernize the Russian aerospace forces which continues to strengthen its combat capabilities despite being caught in a prolonged conflict in Ukraine and facing Western sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union So what makes the SU35S so special the key to its extraordinary flight performance lies in its new power plant featuring engines with digital control systems and vector-controlled thrust This technology allows the aircraft to perform much more agile maneuvers and achieve far better flight performance compared to its predecessors Not only that the SU35S also has adequate strike capabilities for both ground and sea targets Compared to previous models the SU35S is equipped with the IUS35 integrated information and control system which helps reduce the pilot's workload while improving situational awareness The aircraft's radar with a passive electronically scanned array has a detection range of up to 400 km enabling it to engage in long range air combat with various threats With a maximum takeoff weight of 34.5 tons and a top speed of 2,500 kmh the Su35S is ready to face challenges in the skies The aircraft is also equipped with advanced weaponry such as the GSH 3130mm cannon air-to-air missiles with varying ranges CAS series anti-ship missiles and a variety of guided and unguided bombs The SU35S is indeed an attractive option with even some Western media praising its extraordinary capabilities This is the tangible proof of its prowess According to TAS one of the outlets praising the SU35S fighter jet is the renowned German news portal Stern In its report Stern described the Su35s as the most dangerous fighter jet in the world today praising its exceptional maneuverability and its success in the global arms market Next the publication National Interest also expressed praise for the Su35s They quoted a senior Pentagon official who stated that this fighter jet is impressive and dangerous especially if produced in large quantities Even US fighter jets like the F-15 and FA18E would face significant challenges when engaging Russian jets like the SU35 exhausting considerable energy in each battle The Washington Times also aligns with this view stating that the SU35S is superior to most NATO weapons They assess that this fighter jet has great potential for modernization and will become a highly effective combat vehicle with capabilities that will evolve over time What do you think is the SU35S promising enough that's all for today and thanks for watching Hey hey

CLI", "tags": "webdev, app development, lesson, tutorial", "script": "yesterday anthropic finally released Claude 3.7 Sona the highly anticipated large language model that's most loved and most feared by programmers their announcement video has everybody freaking out and the top comment on that video is people waiting for this video and let me just say I'm humbled and honored that you put so much faith into my half-ass AI reviews I've already burned through millions of tokens testing it and the tldr is that Claud 3.7 is straight gas hits different matte heat highkey goated on God no cap for real for real the new base model beat itself to become even better at programming while adding a new thinking mode to copy the success of deep seek R1 in the open AO models but the craziest thing they released is something called Claude code a CLI tool that allows you to build test and execute code in any project thus creating an infinite feedback loop that in theory should replace all programmers all the code influencers are telling us we're cooked and in today's video we'll find out if they're right it is February 25th 2025 and you're watching the code report a few weeks ago anthropic released a paper that studied how AI affects the labor force and what they found is that despite only making up 3.4% of the workforce over 37% of the prompts are related to math and coding and although it hasn't taken any human programmer jobs yet it has taken stack overflows job now there's a lot of AI slot word out there and it's hard to keep track of it all but for web development one of the better indicators is web dev Arena and Claude 3.5 the previous version is already sitting on top of that leaderboard but it was roughly tied with all of the other state-of-the-art models when it comes to the software engineering Benchmark which is human verif ified and based on real GitHub issues what's crazy though is that the new 3.7 model absolutely crushed all the other models including open AI O3 mini high and deep seek and is now capable of solving 70.3% of GitHub issues that is if we're to believe the Benchmark and after trying out the CLA code CLI I might actually believe it it's in research preview currently but you can install the CLA CLI with npm disclaimer though it uses the anthropic API directly and CLA is not cheap costing over 10 times more than models like Gemini Flash and deepsea $15 per million output tokens cost more than my entire personality once installed you'll have access to the CLA command in the terminal and that gives it the full context of existing code in your project one thing I noticed immediately though is that their text decoration in the CLI looks almost identical to SST an open source tool we've covered on this channel before that could be a coincidence but it appears the clo logo might also be plagiarized based on this drawing of a butthole by one of my favorite authors Kurt vonet now there's nothing wrong with designing your logo after a sphincter plenty of companies do it but I think CLA is just a little too on the nose here but now that I have CLA installed I can run the in command which will scan the project and create a markdown file with some initial context and instructions that's cool but now we have an open session and one thing you might want to do is see how much money you've lost by prompting so far with the cost command I can see that creating that AIT file cost about 8 cents now the first actual job I gave it was pretty easy and that was to create a random name generator in Dino after you enter a prompt it will figure out what to do and then have you confirm it with a yes or no like in this case here it wants to generate a new file it'll go ahead and write that file to the file system and then it also creates a dedicated testing file as well that's important because using a strongly typed language along with test driven development are ways for the AI to validate that the code it writes is actually valid if that test fails it can use the feedback to rewrite the business logic and continue going back and forth until it gets it right and in this example it wrote what I would consider perfect code but now let's do something more challenging and have it build an actual visual front end UI but instead of react we'll use spelt when I generated the config you'll notice that it understands the text stack is using typescript and tailwind and then I'll prompt it for a moderately complex front-end UI an application that can access my microphone and visualize the waveform after this initial prompt I had to confirm like 20 different things and as you can see it wrote a bunch of new components to my project it took a lot longer than just prompting claw in the web UI but the end result was worth the wait here in the application I can click through a waveform frequency and circular graphic that visualizes the sound of my voice as a control I had open aai 03 mini High generate the same thing and at first I got an error which was easy to fix but the end result looked like this an embarrassing piece of crap compared to Claude but upon closer inspection there were a lot of problems in claude's code like for one it didn't use typescript or Tailwind at all even though it should know that they're in our Tex stack it also failed to use the new spell 5 Rune syntax and the entire session cost me about 65 cents which would have been better spent on an egg or a banana but now I have one final test recently Apple had to discontinue ending and encryption in the UK because the government wanted a back door and apple refused to build one if you've been affected by this one thing you can do is build your own and an encrypted app I've been trying to do that myself in JavaScript but every single large language model that I've tried fails let's see if Claud code can fix this chat GPT garbage code it took quite a while and changed a lot of the code but for whatever reason it still fails to run and unfortunately because I become so dependent on AI I have no idea how to fix an error message like this and all I can really do is wait for the next best model to come out throughout the video we've seen how good CLA is at front end Dev but the other half to your application is the back end and if you like building apps fast you need to try out convex the sponsor of today's video it's an open- Source reactive database that provides typesafe queries scheduled jobs server functions real-time data sync like Firebase just to name a few of its features best of all though database queries are written in pure typescript giving us this beautiful IDE autocomplete across the entire stack but that also creates another side effect making convex really good at autonomous Vibe coding with AI models like Claude can more easily understand comvex code write it with fewer errors and thus be more productive with it if you know how to build a front-end app you're already halfway there now use the link on the screen to create a free convex project to build the other half this has been the code report thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one",

cost on Cinco Deo and this Mexican fighter with so much heart Edgar tarez shock the M two weeks ago we saw hagard take down nongo that was one of the biggest upsets in mu Thai history if tarz somehow does it here tonight in mu Thai history what nice shots early on from R tag and then the push kick you know typically when we see a newcomer coming to one Championship they don't have any experience doing mu Thai with 4 o gloves but tarz does he's fought some Muay Thai and cages before in the 4 o gloves so this is not new to him relax start for both guys but Edgar tabarz is standing in front there's another one pulling him into the shot but Edgar tabarz has an answer for it he's spinning with the elbows it's the second time he kind of irritated Ro Tang it looked like karz returning fire and another one this one up top from Edgar one two and then the outside he's modeled his style after Rod tang and we're seeing a lot of the same weapons using a lot of push kick a lot of low kicks there just chopping it the leg there that's the punch that put Hagerty down loves that he loves to pull people in and when he did it he landed the body shot I got you on that one stiff hard jab again pulling him in there coming in with a right to follow for Rod T tarez might need to abandon the push kick start faking at least they trade C tabar is standing and trading in this first round with 45 seconds remaining man tarz is standing right in front of him cutting no angles you see tabar's defense there try to come downstairs the body tabar had a really nice tight defense that kept rawang from Landing that straight to the midsection on each other's tells and reads and just sort of get information so they can kind of plan the rest of their match oh rang throwing heat with that right [Applause] [Music] hand ooh Edgar tbar is going up high going toes to the face and that one lands good opening round we go back to Bangkok in this seems to be Rod Tang's sort of desired shot that he wants to land he's landed a couple and Edgar tabarz continues to walk through him I don't know how many of these he's going to be able to take but so far went downstairs with the straight tabar's actually covered it with his elbow that punch and was able to return with a leg kick of his own Bell round two home World title fight fly away at mu Rod tang with the belt tavar is trying to shock the world like how tabarz is answering that's very important in the like Stadium Muay Thai is to not let your opponent get the last shot but raten finding a shot on the head of Taris as tobares takes a knee but not rolled a knockdown yeah wow he stepped in with that lead elbow there I think that actually hurt tbars even though they didn't count that as a knockdown Olivier saw it as as a as a stumble or a slip big combinations from Rod tangman a nice knee from tarz head kick rotang as they trade leather here the second rotang shifted gears here putting a lot of forward pressure on tarz no longer standing Toe to Toe he's walking him down tabarz needs to find something quick yeah tabarz looks like he's also shifted gears in the wrong direction together stepping off and firing again nice jab there by tbars but he's not moving he's got to get that head offline he can't keep that head in the same position Rod Tang's right hand is a heat seeking missile yeah this is what I was talking about in his keys of Victories working those angles being stuck here on the on the fence oh elbow wow elbow clean that's it that's a wrap tarez can he somehow recover and get up no Rod tang in the second you know you watch Raw Tang in the first round when tabarz tried that spin elbow off the kick like a third time raw Tang was greeting greeting that that offense so I am not surprised by that elbow coming over because that's exactly what happened there tbar is looking for the spin rang come over with the elbow and put him down here's a knockout right here he pushed the push kick he tries to come up with the spin elbow and and Rod Tang has seen it one too many times steps right through with an elbow of his own he was waiting for the spin that time because that you go to the well too many times and the well is dry come with the spin elbow ra Tang blocked it immediately come back with an elbow counter of his own put tobar's on the mat one more look at it right here catch the kick drag it go

developed based on the American FE5 E Tiger 2 platform It was designed with the primary goal of reducing Iran's dependency on foreign spare parts Iranian engineers reverse engineered the F5 structure to analyze and replicate its components The Sai project was launched in the early 2000s as the starting point for the indigenous development of military aircraft The first prototype successfully took flight in 2006 The design process of the Sai began with major modifications to its vertical stabilizers While the original F5E had a single vertical tail the Sai was equipped with twin vertical stabilizers This design inspired by the American FA18 offered better stability and maneuverability especially at low altitudes The twintail configuration also enhanced the aircraft's agility and contributed to a more modern and stealthier visual profile The airframe of the Sai is constructed using locally produced alloys and composite materials resistant to pressure and stress Its engine is the J85G21 the same model used in the F5 Iran has managed to overhaul reproduce and even optimize this engine in certain versions Each engine provides around 5,000 pounds of thrust offering flight performance comparable to its American counterpart One of the most notable upgrades in the Sai is its indigenous digital avionic system It features multi-function displays MFDs a head-up display HUD and an internal navigation suite Communication systems have been upgraded for compatibility with other jets and ground control Additionally the aircraft is equipped with radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasure systems improving its survivability in combat zones In terms of weaponry the Saiy can carry 70 mm unguided rockets generalurpose freefall bombs and air-to-air missiles Among these is the AM9 Sidewinder or its Iranian variant The aircraft also supports short-range infraredg guided missiles The underbelly retains provisions for an internal cannon Iran has also worked on integrating precisiong guided munitions in newer versions The SA's lightweight structure and aerodynamic design allow it to perform high-speed maneuvers and quick turns making it suitable for close-range dog fights During domestic joint exercises it has demonstrated acceptable performance in interception and targeting roles It is also used in advanced pilot training missions However its operational range and fuel capacity remain limited To address the range limitation Iran developed an upgraded version known as SE 2 This variant includes an external fuel tank under the fuselage significantly extending its range The increased fuel volume allows the aircraft to participate in longer missions Additionally this model features a fully digitized avionic sweep Some reports also indicate improvements to the engine cooling system SEGI 2 is equipped with advanced positioning and inertial navigation systems These allow the aircraft to navigate combat routes without relying on external GPS sources This capability becomes crucial in electronic warfare environments enhancing its operational survivability Some Sega 2 models are fitted with touchscreen multi-function displays which greatly simplify battlefield management for the pilot To produce the SIGA Iran utilized the capabilities of domestic aerospace firms and academic institutions The Iran Aviation Industries Organization AI AIO and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force IIAF played key roles in the project Malik Ashtar University contributed to the aerodynamic design and advanced materials Currently the aircraft is assembled on domestic production lines Though not mass-produced it has entered service in limited numbers The SIG is primarily deployed for air defense advanced training and combat patrol missions Due to its low maintenance needs and operational costs it is ideal for training fighter pilots Iran has showcased this aircraft in multiple military exercises to demonstrate its deterrence capability Notably it has participated in the defenders of the Veilot sky drills where its performance was wellreceived by local experts In terms of reconnaissance certain Siege variants have been adapted for light Awax and imagery surveillance roles By equipping the aircraft with cameras and electrooptical sensors its capability for patrol and observation has increased Although it lacks long range radar systems it is effective in regional operations It has been frequently deployed along Iran's western and southern borders and has also been trained for anti- drone missions Official Iranian sources claim that the Siege is capable of engaging fourth generation enemy fighters It is considered superior to older F5s in terms of performance and systems Although it cannot compete with more advanced platforms like the F-16 or Sue35 its lightweight design and practical range make it a valuable complement to other air defense systems It also plays an important role in preparing pilots for heavier combat aircraft In terms of stealth the Sai features a slightly reduced radar cross-section RCS compared to the original F5 thanks to its twintail design and angular body shape While it does not qualify as a stealth fighter it is harder to detect than earlier models New paint schemes with radar absorbent coatings have also been tested on certain variants contributing to Iran's long-term ambition of developing stealth aircraft Economically the Siege is significantly cheaper to produce than imported fighter jets Its hourly flight cost is lower than that of many other aircraft maintenance spare parts and crew training are all conducted domestically This self-reliance enhances Iran's defense independence amid ongoing sanctions Some sources suggest that each SIGE costs about 25% of an F-16's price The SEI project gave Iran invaluable experience in reverse engineering This expertise later contributed to projects like the Kosar fighter and jet powered drones It also raised the level of aeronautical engineering knowledge across Iranian universities Engineers learned how to build complex systems with limited tools and resources An achievement that marks a turning point in the country's pursuit of military self-sufficiency Iran is seeking to export the SIE to allied countries Although sanctions have posed significant obstacles however the primary goal has been to gain experience for developing more advanced generations of aircraft The knowledge acquired through this project laid the foundation for the development of the Kosar Yasin and future designs Saigi is not merely a fighter jet It stands as a symbol of Iran's industrial independence and resilience Despite all limitations this aircraft has managed to defy doubts and demonstrate capability under pressure",

What unfolded in this clash of titans left fans   questioning everything they thought \nthey knew about these warriors. Brace yourself: this fight took an \nunexpected turn that nobody saw coming. Welcome to 'Fight Legends \nUnleashed,' where we take   you straight into the heart of the most \njaw-dropping showdowns in combat sports. Today, we’re talking about a fight that \nhad everyone on the edge of their seats. Rodtang Jitmuangnon, also known as “The \nIron Man,” is Muay Thai’s human wrecking   ball, and went head-to-head with \n'Mighty Mouse' Demetrious Johnson,   the MMA mastermind who’s been \nrewriting the rulebook for years. This clash had fans holding their breath, \nwondering who’d be the last man standing. Let’s break down how this \nexplosive battle played out   and why it’s still got the fight world buzzing. On March 26, 2022, the combat sports \nworld saw something unforgettable. Two legends were about to collide \nat the ONE X event in Singapore. This fight had a twist: round \none would follow Muay Thai rules,   and round two would be under MMA rules. In one corner was Rodtang Jitmuangnon, a Muay Thai \npowerhouse with over 300 fights by the age of 24. Known for his relentless aggression and \nhis ability to take hits like no other,   Rodtang had become a living legend, feared for \nhis relentless pressure and devastating strikes. On the other side was Demetrious \n'Mighty Mouse' Johnson, a former   UFC Flyweight Champion and one of the \nmost adaptable fighters in MMA history. Johnson’s speed, technique, and fight \nIQ made him a force to be reckoned with. But this time, he was stepping into Rodtang’s \nterritory: the brutal world of Muay Thai. The big question was clear: Could \nJohnson survive Rodtang’s onslaught,   or would Rodtang be outsmarted \nby Johnson’s MMA brilliance? As the bell rang for round one, the \nenergy in the arena was electric. Rodtang Jitmuangnon wasted no time, \ncharging at Demetrious Johnson with   the intensity that had made him a Muay Thai icon. This round was all about Muay Thai, \nand Rodtang was in his element. Right from the start, he unleashed a barrage \nof powerful kicks, elbows, and punches,   pushing forward with the kind of aggression \nthat had overwhelmed so many opponents before. Johnson, stepping into unfamiliar \nterritory with Muay Thai rules,   found himself struggling to keep \nup with Rodtang’s relentless pace. Rodtang was clearly in control,   dominating the round as he pressed \nforward with brutal combinations. At times, Rodtang could be seen smiling \nand even laughing, a clear sign of how   comfortable he felt in his domain. For him, this round seemed almost effortless,   as if he were toying with the \nchallenge in front of him. Johnson, known for his calm under \npressure, tried to stay composed. He moved with precision, using his \nfootwork to evade some of Rodtang’s   strikes, but it was clear that he was on the \ndefensive, trying to survive the onslaught. Every time Johnson attempted to find an opening,   Rodtang shut it down with a fierce strike, \nreminding everyone why he’s feared in the ring. Johnson’s usual confidence was \ntested as he grappled with the   challenge of Muay Thai’s raw power and pace. Despite his best efforts to counter,   Rodtang’s relentless pressure \nkept him from finding his rhythm. Rodtang’s dominance was evident: he \ncontrolled the distance, dictated the   pace, and landed the heavier shots, all \nwhile keeping Johnson on his back foot. The crowd roared with every crushing blow, sensing \nthat Rodtang was fully in charge of the round. As the seconds ticked away, it became \nclear that Johnson’s primary goal was   to make it through to the next round, \nwhere the rules would shift in his favor. The tension in the arena was palpable as the \nfirst round came to a close, with Rodtang firmly   in control, his confidence on full display, and \nJohnson left to regroup for what was coming next.

With the rules now favoring MMA, this was \nJohnson’s moment. Rodtang, still riding   high from his dominance in the first round, \ncharged forward again, but Johnson was ready. With lightning speed, Johnson \nsecured a rear-mount clinch,   latching onto Rodtang’s back as the Muay \nThai powerhouse tried to shake him off. Rodtang, in a desperate attempt to dump Johnson \nover his shoulder, made a move to the ground. But Johnson, always vigilant, \nused this moment to his advantage. As they hit the canvas, Johnson seamlessly \ntransitioned into a full rear-naked choke,   locking in the submission \nhold with intense precision. Rodtang fought back with everything he had,   struggling against the choke, \nhis iron will on full display. For nearly a full minute, he resisted, \nrefusing to go down easily. The crowd   watched in suspense as Rodtang’s movements \ngrew slower, his oxygen slipping away. Finally, despite his best efforts, \nRodtang lost consciousness. The referee stepped in, and Demetrious 'Mighty \nMouse' Johnson was declared the winner. The arena exploded with applause \nas Johnson made a victory lap. He had outlasted Rodtang and \nshowcased his unmatched versatility,   turning the tide of the fight in dramatic fashion. This fight was a thrilling reminder of \nthe unpredictability that makes combat   sports so captivating, especially in the \nhigh-stakes arena of ONE Championship. When two legends step into \nthe ring, anything can happen. For Rodtang, this bout put his incredible \nstriking power on full display, but it also   highlighted the challenges he faces when \nventuring beyond his usual battlefield. Fans are now left wondering: Is Rodtang \nwilling to step into uncharted territory again,   or will he focus on dominating the Muay Thai \nscene, where his reign remains undisputed? As for Demetrious 'Mighty Mouse' \nJohnson, this victory stands as   a defining moment in a career that has \nset the standard for greatness in MMA. Having recently announced his \nretirement on September 6, 2024,   Johnson leaves the sport as one of the most \nversatile and accomplished fighters of all time. His ability to adapt and conquer opponents \nwill be remembered as a hallmark of his legacy. In the ever-evolving world of ONE Championship,   where the best from every discipline \ncollide, Johnson’s victories,   including this one, will continue to \ninspire fighters for generations to come. This clash between two titans from different \nrealms will be remembered as a night that   perfectly captured what makes ONE Championship - \nand combat sports in general - so electrifying:   the surprises, the skill, and the \nrelentless heart of true champions.

investing, dividend investing wealthsimple", "script": "hi everyone and welcome to another wealth simple RSP update it's been about 6 months since I've last done one I'll probably be doing every 3 months going forward so right now I've had my RSP with WTH simple for about four years I'm going to say November 20120 and I used to put 150 every month and then I recently updated it well 6 months ago I updated to 400 a month I'm just going to show you what it looks like I have $47,000 in here I'm up 27% which is okay but like take a look at this so if we look at the one year I'm up 14% sounds good right but you can only know how you're performing if you compare it to the market and the market is the S&P 500 so looking at spy the last year I'm about 50% of the market but I'm not in my wealth in my wealth simple portfolio I'm not just um investing in the S&P 500 I'm investing globally if we look at the last six months it's up 11% six months here is 16.8 so not not the biggest variance but it's still trailing but who knows maybe over the long term W simple could catch up if the S&P 500 or the US doesn't do as well but just looking at this chart these are my investments if you see this big increase this is just because I put in another $5,000 so when you hover over the chart the black dotted line the hidden one that's what I've deposited so you can see my uh I was doing 150 a month 150 every two weeks which is why the increas is the steps up are very little here and then I increased nice this is great then I've increased to 400 every two weeks and randomly I did a sale and after every real estate sale I try to put $5,000 into RSP just to reduce my tax burden so that's where the $5,000 comes in here and then we're going to go in this was group RSP and I had one before but I deleted it because I moved it to another account and this is RSP this is managed managed means it's by well simple Robo advisers and it pays around I pay around 0.5% per year and I could prove that hopefully I can prove that through the activity a little later um non-registered and I withdrew it this is a glitch on wealth simple like I didn't lose 100% which doesn't make sense they have a savings account I had the crypto I don't really know why I have $4 in crypto I think that okay that's my ethereum I guess I have $4 in ethereum but I can't sell because it's too low if you want they have many other accounts if you want to add tfsa RSP which I have non-registered which is when you this is you know only open this after you maxed out the first two first Home Savings Account you could do a lra corporate account these are available on the mobile app only I'll do the app in another video this one U my RSP updates have always been on desktops I'm just showing that here but there are more more there are more options and features available on the mobile app so if we go back here let's click on the managed account I like that they show you um you know by just like your retirement plan by the time I'm 65 assuming I deposit 400 every two weeks I'll have 1.46 million which is great but that's why 65 I kind of want to retire by 55 which 612 which is not not that good I've deposited 400 in July I have Auto deposits here you can add more if you want I'll try to block my account information if it shows up so let's click on this cool so I can deposit $44,000 instantly I don't know why it says that that's a random number or you could use interact you could deposit up to $33,000 within 30 minutes which is great I like the instant satisfaction of getting money I don't know why it say $44,000 but that's story for another day we go down here it is what's complicated about this you have to choose based on certain um answers that you give like how long your time Horizon is or what what you're Investing For so I said my time Horizon is 20 years and I'm investing for retirement and then it gave me a portfolio risk from 1 to 10 I chose 10 you're supposed to go risky if you're supposed to invest for a retirement over the long term 20 years for me is long term I guess for everyone it's long term I chose 10 but it was 90% equity and 10% fixed income I don't want fixed income that's ruining my return that's why I think I've only made 22% over the last 4 years when I should have made more so I emailed them and asked them can I turn my portfolio up to an 11 11 means 100% equities and I told them where is it so I told them their 9010 portfolio is lame and they did reply saying they fended it's kind of funny but they turned my account into 100% equity and that's why it says customized portfolio because I turned it up to an1 pretty much and it can tell you what it's uh what you're invested in so let me show you here you can click the you can see what they invest for you and how many shares of this I have so of my 47,000 15,000 of it is in vti and then you can see everything else what you're what you're invested in so this should say 20 years so this is what I was saying your risk portfolio your risk profile file I said 20 years and then retirement you know I probably should have said this at the beginning of the video you can move an account if you are investing with a company if you're investing with Quest trade you want to move over or TD Bank or anyone else you can click here account type I want to move any one of these let's say I have an RSP account click next and then you select who your current account is with so for example if it's with world source Financial you can select like that and then you put in your account number and they can withdraw your account for you and move it here and they do cover the first $155,000 of fees no if you if you move $115,000 or more they'll they'll cover the fees for you which is great if you go to activity you can see everything from my $400 where the Investments went so this is what they bought with it and I want to see if we could show the fee so I put in $400 and you can see what they bought here where are the fees management fee okay so I mentioned it was 0.5% per year and if I have $47,000 let's try to and this is monthly let's see what happens so we have 20.8 if we just go so $250 a year and $47,000 portfolio times 100 so let's say I'm paying 0.53 just based on this if we do simple math so it is not free which nothing ever is but 0.5% is much better than certain Banks or what Mutual fun mutual funds charge they sometimes charge 2.55% which really eats into your Investments is there anything else I want to show move accounts I could add money you could transfer I'm not transferring anything here I don't do much on the wealth simple website to be honest this is a set it and forget it style of investing that's why I'm doing this I auto deposit $400 from every pay paycheck so let's say 800 a month 9,600 a year and they invest for me there's nothing for me to do I come in I check in every few months to see if the amount went up it did when I deposited the $5,000 I checked in a few days just to make sure it went in but yeah it's pretty pretty straightforward I like this type of investing so I don't really have to think about it and this is for pretty much other investors so what I what I was trying to do here is see if I could beat the market or if if we simple would match the market so I'm doing this for Content pretty much if I didn't have a YouTube channel I wouldn't have invested in well simple I I think I could make more on my own which I've shown in my other options trading videos but if you're looking for a set it and forget it style of investing I'm going to make another video on how to open an account but that one might not be for the manage so this is just for the robo advisor style of investing 05% per year do I have like a code let me see if I could find like a referral code okay so I'm going in here I'm a core client don't know what that means top core benefits sure 4% spend and save yeah so I don't I don't think there are referral codes anymore I think they'd push it more but that's all right I'm going to leave it here it's been a while but hopefully I could do every three months I'll just do an update if people are interested thanks for watching and tune in to the next one e", "duration(in seconds)": 549.0, "region": "US"}}

there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate the I I think your question is so stupid i mean I think it's a I don't want anything to go down but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something i want more people to show up and uh get him out of office he's terrible donald Trump announced the tariffs last week the world first blinked then it panicked then markets crashed and then trillions were wiped off just today the S&P 500 added and erased $2.5 trillion in one hour all on the basis of what was later called a fake news headline $2.5 trillion but the US president does not seem to care he does not think it's a it's a bad thing in fact Trump believes that this is exactly what America needs a bitter pill is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate I I think your question is so stupid i mean I think it's a I don't want anything to go down but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something which has led many to ask the question did Trump do it on purpose did he want the markets to crash i know it's a weird question to ask but there's no smoke without fire and the fire was lit by the president himself on Friday he reposted a video link on his social media platform Truth Social the video is by a Tik Tok user and this is what he's suggesting trump is crashing the market on purpose trump is crashing the stock market by 20% this month but he's doing it on purpose and this is why Warren Buffett just said Trump is making the best economic moves he's seen in over 50 years now here's the secret game he's playing and it could make you rich so how does this even work the video claims that this is like a wild chess move trump imposes the tariffs the market crashes he forces money into US Treasury bonds the Fed cuts interest rates lower rates mean lower mortgage payments the dollar becomes weaker companies end up making more in America so grocery prices tumble and somehow the middle class is saved it sounds convoluted it also sounds like a classic conspiracy theory because it most probably is the funny part is that Trump seems to be backing it in fact this has been his position and calculation throughout look at his latest post on Truth Social trump says and I'm quoting \"Oil prices are down interest rates are down food prices are down and there is no inflation.\" And the longtime abused USA is bringing in billions of dollars a week from the abusing countries on tariffs that are already in place so Trump clearly believes that tariffs are a good thing that this is America's bitter pill but is the bitter pill too bitter americans certainly think so they have been protesting in all 50 states thousands of Americans took to the streets over the weekend they had just two words for their president hands off i think it's important to speak up i think silence is not an option i think you have to stay engaged you have to stay vigilant i think is is not only for our community at large but the world at large i think that enough is enough we object to the uh everything that uh Donald Trump is doing basically in terms of his power grab and all the damage he's doing to the economy and to democracy that's why I'm I'm saying the Trump slump is basically the the stock market's crashing the economy is going to crash it's already crashing and it's it's all about Trump it's all his his actions his stupidity his uh mistakes the protest stretched from New York to Los Angeles around 600,000 people signed up organizers claimed the number was more than a million either way anger is clearly in the air not just at rallies or on the streets but also in quieter battlegrounds like grocery lines in less than two weeks America will celebrate Easter but this year the Easter bunnies got budget issues because Americans cannot even afford eggs back in February prices cracked a record $8 for a dozen eggs prices have dipped a little since but they are still not exactly sunny side up and eggs are not just for breakfast they are an Easter tradition so Americans are turning to the next best thing dyed potatoes for instance because they're cheap others are stuffing plastic cases some are also eyeing golf balls basically anything cheaper and round that can be passed off as eggs and this is just one example americans are rushing to stock up on things on groceries on apparel even on furniture some in fact are buying cars too all before tariffs cause a massive price hike but will any of this force Trump to rethink his policy it looks unlikely at the moment trump is still selling his tariffs as some kind of miracle cure the markets are swallowing that medicine and they're showing serious side effects like panic plummeting portfolios and economic indigestion but even Trump must know that playing Jenga with the economy is a risky game so this is where America is at the moment caught between a president prescribing economic shock therapy and a public tired of being the guinea pig donald Trump calls his plan visionary his critics call it volatile because for team Trump it may be a high stakes experiment in power but for millions of Americans it's a battle for survival greeting you with aloha and namaste i I love India presence uh occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India what we saw in Kashmir and the prime minister how do you see Trump's America yes the current administration behaves differently from the previous administration [Music] are you saying that there are foreign powers who are trying to bring down the current government in Syria Exactly [Music] prime Minister Modi committed to South South you know cooperations for [Music] not over 50% is Ukraine prepared to pay the price for that peace no compromises at the cost of

Joining us now with her view on the current state of the markets, Gabriella Santos, J.P. Morgan Asset Management chief market strategist for Americas. It's a. It's the best of times. It's the worst of times I think. And that's your point. If there weren't some of these external things happening, the base case is still pretty solid in terms of earnings and margins and the economy and everything else. But you don't know at this point how all this is going to play out. >> I think that the first thing that we do have to appreciate in moments where there is a lot of change, is the actual underlying momentum coming into this moment. And we ended 2024 with real domestic final demand growing 3%. We had been surprised over and over with the resilience of the economy, especially the consumer. And we had most importantly, a broadening in earnings growth. With the magnificent seven growing earnings 15% in the fourth quarter, finally seeing margins start to improve again. So that's really, really important. This is a resilient economy with good momentum. That said, I think the markets are now trying to figure out exactly the decimal points for this year, which is a lot of function of a lot of crosscurrents in policy. And we do seem to be starting to see a cooling in the economy. But it's a cooling. It's not cool. So it's more just trying to figure out the contours around the edges. How does all this change in tariff and trade policy affect sentiment, affect CapEx, consumption margins, revenue growth? How does the change in government spending also affect confidence? Maybe employment? So how do all these different puzzle pieces fit together? >> I wish it was just decimal points and you're turning decimal points to the right. That's right. Of the to the right. >> Yes to the right of the period. >> To the right of the period. >> When it starts affecting according to the Atlanta Fed, it's actually affected numbers to the left of the decimal point and GDP. >> And that to us seems like a bit of a we don't want to overreact to what happened in two trading days. Is the Atlanta Fed GDP now went from 2% to -2.8%. So there are two separate artificial issues here masking that underlying change. The first related to the import surge that we seem to have had, we're going to get more trade data this Thursday. What seems to have happened is a big surge in imports of gold, which is the BA, does not include in its GDP calculation. So just a mechanical thing there. And then the second one is related to sentiment. There has been a big decline. For example yesterday ISM manufacturing. But that's soft data. We have to actually see what's really happening in the underlying hard data. That's why this Friday's jobs report will be so important. And I think it can be a relief for investors to see that. Our expectation is we're still creating over 150,000 jobs. So there is still a continuation of momentum. It's more of a cooling. It's not cool. And for us the underlying momentum is closer to 2%. >> If you are right. >> The administration could make the case that if its decimal points, this is when you'd want to make some of the moves for the long term to correct some of the imbalances that that they see, whether it's trade, whether it's the size of government, whether it's government spending, you might be you might be just feeding into the impulses of the administration to do it now instead of some other time. >> And I do think it's going to depend on exactly how much we see all at once. It is starting to. >> How long it. >> Lasts and how long it lasts. I do think there is somewhat of a consensus in the market right this second that maybe especially these 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico are not persistent. We'll have to see the scope of the change, how long it lasts, and whether it's just these more recent developments that's affecting negatively the supply and the demand side of the economy, or whether we start to get some of the other policy aspects that are actually pro and boosting the supply side and the demand side of the economy and how those two interact. I think for the short term, while there is still uncertainty about this, what we saw in 2018 is a period of multiple contraction to try to factor in these different possible outcomes. And then eventually, if they are persistent, maybe start to factor that in into earnings estimates. So I would say just two quick implications here. The first is really that we had been talking about going into this year. Just taking a look at the portfolio drift that might have happened in portfolios. A lot more exposure to risk. I see you see bonds doing their job with yields moving lower. The AG moving higher 2.5%. So having some real growth diversifiers in there. And then the second is not turning too much to the cyclical trade quite yet. It's too early for that. It's usually out of a recession. So for us it's diversifying within the market but much more of a quality factor tilt. For now. >> We were going to have Howard Lutnick on the he does just bowl right. He always has an answer for everything and just, you know, headlong into these things. But is it fentanyl. Is it dairy in Canada. Do we want factories built here or there? I don't know what. I'm not sure exactly what the end game is. Is it renegotiating the Usmca and just not sure. We need to be clear on when we are able to take things off and what the you know, is it really fentanyl? I Gabriella, thanks. >> Are there concessions to closing. >> The loop. >> For", "duration(in seconds)": 371.0, "region": "US"}}

Hello and welcome back to \nAccounting Stuff. I'm James and today we're   talking financial statements. The income statement, \nthe balance sheet and the cash flow statement. I'm   going to try and explain all the basics in under \neight minutes which is going to be a challenge   because we have a little puppy here who's uh \ntrying to bite my finger. So let's get started!   What are financial statements? Financial \nstatements are reports that summarize the   activities and financial performance of a business. \nThey're prepared at the end of each accounting   period and they're designed to give investors and \nlenders a feel for a business's financial health.   The three main financial statements are the balance \nsheet, the income statement and the cash flow   statement. Now I'll explain how each of these \nwork with an example. Tea-licious is a family-run   business that produces a popular blend of black \ntea. Their financial year has come to a close and   they've finished putting together their financial \nstatements so let's look at them. We'll start with   the balance sheet. What is a balance sheet? The \nbalance sheet is a financial statement that gives   us a snapshot of a business's assets, liabilities \nand equity at a single point in time. The balance   sheet is also called the statement of financial \nposition and it looks like this. In the header we   have the business's name followed by the name of \nthe financial statement and directly below that   we have the point in time that we're looking at. A \nsnapshot of December 31st. On the left hand side of   the balance sheet we have a list of everything the \nbusiness owns - its assets - and on the right we have   everything the business owes its liabilities and \nequity. Tea-licious owes liabilities to third parties   like its suppliers, its employees and the tax \noffice. But it also owes equity back to the owners   of the business. This includes their original \ncapital contributions which is the cash the owners   injected into the business and retained earnings \nwhich are the cumulative profits that the business   has held onto. If we collapse the balance sheet \ndown into its core components then we can see   that Tea-licious has total equity of 129.5 million \ndollars. What does this mean? Well if the business   were to suddenly sell off all of its assets and \npay off all of its debts then in theory, this is   how much money the owners would get. At the bottom \nof the balance sheet Tea-licious has total assets   of 169 million dollars and total liabilities and \nequity of 169 million dollars. The stuff it owns is   equal to the stuff it owes. So the balance sheet \nis in balance. Which is fantastic news because   a balance sheet always has to balance. Why? Because \nit says so in the accounting equation. Assets shall   always equal liabilities plus equity. Or the stuff \nthat a business owns is equal to the stuff that   a business owes. What is an income statement? An \nincome statement is a financial statement that   summarizes a business's revenues and expenses \nover a period of time. If the balance sheet is   a snapshot of a point in time then the income \nstatement is more like a video or a boomerang   covering a range of time. The income statement \nlooks like this. As you can see in the header   the income statement covers a period of time. \nThe year ended December 31st. And in the   body of the report we have a summary of revenue \nearned and expenses incurred. If we collapse it   then we find it the income statement is really \nshowing us three things. Firstly, Tea-licious made   255 million dollars in revenue. Which is their top \nline income that it earned from selling products   during the year. Secondly, it incurred 248 million \ndollars in expenses. This includes the direct and   indirect costs of running the business and finally \nwhen we subtract expenses from revenue we see that   Tea-licious generated seven million dollars in net \nprofit on the bottom line. Profitability is key to   the income statement which is why it's also called \nthe statement of profit and loss. It tells us how   much profit the business earned over a period of \ntime. But be careful here because profit doesn't   necessarily translate to cash flow. Which is why \nbusinesses also need a cash flow statement. What   is a cash flow statement? A cash flow statement \nis a financial statement that shows a business's   cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. \nBusinesses need to make a cash flow statement   if they are using accrual accounting. You see \nthere are two methods of accounting. We have   the cash method and the accrual method. The cash \nmethod of accounting is often used by smaller   businesses it says that revenue is recognized \nwhen cash is received and expenses are recorded   when cash is paid out. Under the cash method the \nincome statement and the cash flow statement are   equivalent to one another. If cash comes in we \nrecord revenue and if cash goes out we record   an expense. It's nice and simple but it has its \nlimitations. What if Tea-licious makes a large sale   but the customer doesn't pay the invoice until the \nfollowing accounting period. Their revenue could be   understated in the period that they made the sale \nand overstated in the following period when they   received the cash. There has to be a better way! \nAnd thankfully there is. The accrual method says   that we should recognize revenue as it's earned \nand record expenses as they are incurred. When   the substance of the transaction takes place. This \nmeans that cash inflows and outflows aren't equivalent   to revenues and expenses. They need to be tracked \nseparately in the cash flow statement. A cash flow   statement looks like this. In the header we have \nthe period of time that it relates to, just like   we had in the income statement. And in the body \nwe have two main sections. At the bottom we have   the opening and closing cash balances for the \nfinancial year. We get these numbers from the   balance sheet Tea-licious started out with 11 \nmillion dollars and finished up with 12 million   dollars. So overall that's a net increase in cash \nof one million dollars. But how did this come about?   This is where the top section comes in. We work out \nthe cash flow from operating activities, investing   activities and financing activities. Cash flow \nfrom operating activities covers regular business   activities. How much cash Tea-licious brought \nin and spent whilst selling tea. Tea-licious is   using the direct method so this section mirrors an \nincome statement prepared under the cash method of   accounting. Cash flow from investing activities \nlooks outside of the core operations of the   business. These are the cash inflows and outflows \nfrom investments and buying or selling property   and equipment. Cash flow from financing activities \nis all about funding the business, either through   loans from banks or equity from the owners \nof the business. If we collapse this all down   then the net cash flow on the top should match up \nwith the net cash flow on the bottom. It does here   which means the cash flow statement is reconciled. \nLet's do a quick recap. The balance sheet gives us   a snapshot of a business's assets, liabilities and \nequity at a single point in time. It shows us what   a business owns and what it owes. It also tells us \nhow much the business is worth to its owners. And   then we have the income statement which shows us \na business's revenues and expenses over a period   of time. When we take the difference we can see if \nit made a profit or a loss. The cash flow statement   reveals a business's cash inflows and outflows \nover a period of time. These are reconciled back   to the movement in cash in the balance sheet. \nI've made videos and cheat sheets covering   each of these financial statements. You can find \nlinks to all of that down in the description.   And a big thanks to all my channel members you \nknow who you are and I appreciate your support.   Thank you from both of us. This is Winnie by \nthe way... and we'll see you in the next one!", "duration(in seconds)": 546.0, "region": "US"}}

years ago we're watching the New York Stock Exchange this morning to see how markets react to news of former president Trump's reelection we should hear the opening bell shortly ABC News Chief business correspondent Rebecca Jarvis joins me now for more on this Rebecca there is the opening well Bell going into this the Dow was set to open roughly 12200 points higher what's the latest and what do you make of that well what you're seeing is stocks are open opening considerably higher and I've talked to a number of veterans on Wall Street what what they say is the fact that this was a decisive Victory the fact that this is not a long drawn out election night that we have an answer now we know who won uh that's adding some fuel to where stocks are opening right now you also have what are known as the Trump trade stocks like Tesla with Elon Musk one of president now elect Trump's biggest supporters throughout this election his company Tesla Elon musk's company Tesla those shares surging today you have shares in many of the types of companies that investors believe will get a boost from now president-elect Trump in office things like energy companies uh even Bitcoin some of the crypto companies with the president-elect starting uh a new crypto uh company with his family in the last couple of months these are all the types of things that are getting a boost the question is how long obviously does does it last there's a lot of enthusiasm right now and investors will continue to think about these things as they get more into the minutia of what the policies actually look like what they actually mean for businesses I I will say Diane however I've talked to a lot of companies in the leadup to this and one of the biggest things about this election is that companies were waiting to make decisions because it left so much up in the air for their business they told me no matter who won they felt like finally they could start to make decisions about hiring about spending so I do expect businesses in the next couple of months here to be able to make some of the decisions that were held up by this election we went into this election with the S&P 500 of 21% it's the best election year since 1936 several other economic reports have been strong as of late and yet we hear this response this record number in recent history at least in the last few years number of Voters saying they're worse off now than they were four years ago how do you square that well it's something that you see not just here in the US but internationally the last four years the inflation of the last four years is what voters are talking about when they talk about the economy I talk to voters all the time and whether it's the jobs Market or the stock market those are really off to the side it is the price people are paying at the grocery store at the gas station for their rent for their child care for their health care and all of those things have gone up consider considerably over the last 3 years while inflation has come down it's not spiking any longer it's back basically where you would consider it normal prices haven't come down and getting back to those prices of three years ago it's going to be a really long road the typical family right now is paying about $1,200 more every month on the same goods and services as they were three years ago the FED has been fighting this fight through uh both interest rate increases and what we anticipate will tomorrow an interest rate cut um because they as far as the FED is concerned have sort of won that inflation fight at this point because inflation has normalized but still again prices are higher and that's going to be something for now president-elect Trump to try to deal with in his presidency well and I want to dig in a little deeper on that because we talk about inflation but that's not the same as high prices right inflation has sort of leveled out it's almost at that Target that the FED laid out you know at the 2% Target we're at 2 and a half% pry close right now prices are growing but when milk is eight bucks even once inflation levels out that just means that price isn't increasing that much anymore but that still means it's going to be eight bucks for a while and it's going to keep going up even slightly well until companies decide that or consumers decide that they're really not going to make a purchase and as a result of not making that purchase businesses have to make a decision of whether or not to lower the price you are starting to to see some of that I mean in fast food chains we've seen the likes of McDonald's and Starbucks and a lot of the sort of fast food types of restaurants have recently begun to lower their prices and that's because you have seen the consumer change habits with prices as high as they've gotten but that doesn't exist yet at the grocery store where you see egg prices for example up 161% over the last 3 years people feel that and again like you said inflation is the rate of change but prices even though the rate of change has really dramatically slowed down from where it was spiking prices are not coming down and we still feel that every time you go to the grocery store that's for sure now when you spoke to voters about the economy being one of the critical issues in this election you said they were specifically concerned about about inflation and so given the context of everything we just said how do you see the Trump Administration tackling this issue particularly if it's not just about inflation but about those high prices right it's it's not an easy Road it's not going to be an easy road ahead of course you have the Federal Reserve with its own monetary policy and it will do everything in its power to keep prices stable the types of policies we've heard uh from from Trump the candidate are things like tax reductions uh reimposing the 2017 tax cuts making sure that businesses if they're trying to bring something in from outside of the United States that they have to pay a really high tariff those kinds of things can end up translating to higher prices for consumers at least in the near term and and it's interesting we heard uh from Elon Musk as he was talking about this election as he was talking about candidate Trump he said something to the effect of there will be temporary pain in other words some of these policies which economists look at you ask 10 economists what they think of the policy they might give you different answers about what the outcome will be Elon Musk his belief is that there is going to be some temporary pain initially because these policies don't translate immediately into lower prices and I think from talking to families who have been under the weight of these prices for a very long time that that's a really difficult road because if you don't have the money to make the payment to make the rent payment to to pay the the heat bill you can't wait 12 months for the policy to kick in all right Chief business correspondent Rebecca Jarvis I know you will be watching this throughout Rebecca we appreciate it as always yes than thank you", "duration(in

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

you're able to start saving rather than living paycheck to paycheck a situation that describes more than one in three American workers across many different income levels after covering your monthly expenses like groceries Health Care your rent or house payment you've got $200 left over what should you do with this money there's two places people usually look paying off their debt or investing in the stock market to watch the money grow and save for retirement so which one sets up for a better Financial outcome in the long run there's no simple answer but there is a rule of thumb that can help you start thinking about [Music] this the number that experts say tips this scale in either direction be it pay your debts or invest is seven that's a 7% interest rate the amount by which a debt or investment grows over time you'll sometimes see this Tipping Point number as 6% or 5% after factoring in considerations like how close a person is to retiring but since 7% is the low end of the growth you can expect from investing over time that's where the scale will balance out for the purposes of this video if your debt has a lower interest rate below 7% it's considered mathematically more beneficial to put that $200 toward investing in an index fund an investment fund that tracks the performance of a market index like the S&P 500 for example these are a hands-off way to invest your money that generally carry a lower risk than investing in individual stocks the S&P 5 500 going back decades grows at an average rate of about 7% when adjusted for inflation some years are much higher than that and some years are much lower but generally if your debt interest rate is below 7% you stand to earn more over time by investing rather than tackling the debt right away past 7% though the interest adding to what you owe outpaces any growth you could reasonably rely on through investing the way to think of it is just which one enhances your net worth from year to year because it is sort of a balance sheet issue what you own minus what you owe and I think 7% is a good guideline looking at the math really shows how this 7% rule of thumb Works let's say you have $10,000 in debt at a 5% interest rate that's about the average rate of federal student loans for undergraduates over the past 10 years and let's say this debt has a monthly minimum payment of $150 that you have to pay every month along with all your other necessary expenses there's a bunch of calculators online that can show you how long it will take to pay down this debt based on your monthly payments and how much total interest it will cost you in the end in our hypothetical scenario if you pay just the minimum payment without contributing anything extra it will take you about 6 and 1 12 years to pay off this debt and you will have acred around $1,700 in interest on top of the original $1,000 but if you put that extra $200 per month as an additional payment toward this debt it's gone in 2 and 1/2 years and your total interest is under $700 paying it off faster means you have $1,000 more in your pocket but let's go back to scenario one you pay your debts minimum payments and rack up $1,700 in interest over 6 and 1/2 years and during that time period you invest your $200 per month into the S&P 500 instead of paying down the debt sooner even at the more conservative 7% expected rate of return you end up earning around $4,000 in total interest so sure you've added $1,700 of interest to your debt but you earned $44,000 by investing that's $2,400 extra in your pocket instead of 1,000 from paying off your debt faster but now let's crank this debt interest rate up to 13% a typical interest rate to take out a subprime loan one given to someone with a below average credit score to buy a new car paying just the minimum payment it would take you almost 10 years to pay this off and you'd have racked up $7,800 in interest on top of the original debt but if you put in your extra $2 $ per month here this debt is gone in just under 3 years and you'll pay around $2,000 in interest so you come out ahead by $5,800 in interest saved by using your money to get this debt paid sooner so let's do the invest scenario for this one if you pay just the minimum payment on your debt and invest your $200 per month over those 10 years you can conservatively expect to earn around $10,000 in compound interest which sounds nice but when you subtract the $7,800 the debt grew in interest you end up with a net gain of just under $2,400 which is less than half as much as you would have ended up with if you had paid the debt down sooner so whichever side of this scale accumulates more interest has the higher rate of return that's where you generally want to put your money of course using seven as the Tipping Point on this scale is just a rule of thumb and life is much more complicated than a single math equation plus different kinds of debt carry dramatically different costs let's unpack that

often with low interest rates especially at the undergraduate level one of the harder to manage sources of debt is credit card debt credit card interest rates have been turning above 20% for the last few years and can go even higher especially for people with lower credit scores the likelihood that even the most Savvy investor could consistently reach that level of return from the stock market is very very low when you have debt that is growing at over 20 % there's almost no reason not to eliminate that as soon as possible a federal law pass in 2009 actually required credit card companies to display on each statement how long it will take to pay off the debt and the additional interest incurred by going with the minimum payment and show you what you need to pay each month to eliminate the debt in 3 years plus what you'd save an interest by doing it there's one other important step a financial planner will tell you to take care of before deciding what to do with extra cash and that is to have an emergency fund set aside just in case the guidance you'll often get is for this fund to be at a minimum $1,000 to cover an unexpected expense ideally though this security blanket is bigger the classic advice is 3 to 6 months of must pay expenses that's the mortgage or the rent that's the groceries that's Health Care things like that the experts I talked to for this story emphasized that any investment in the stock market always comes with some risk and that could be a big factor for someone choosing between these two paths 7% rule or not I will just double down on there are no guarantees in the stock market you have so many more options and so much more flexibility if you're debt-free there's just a a benefit to being debt free that you really can't quantify so if you're someone who would rather avoid the risk of investing no matter how high or low your debts interest rate is well then you have your answer [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 488.0, "region": "US"}}

opinion uh but I'm also a big fan of cloud code uh I kind of like the agentic workflow using cloud code so I wanted to find a way to make those two model collaborate and see if they can build something together so I went ahead I created an MCP server that connects to the Gemini 2.5 Pro API so now we have the opportunity for Claude 3.7 to actually collaborate with Gemini to create something so today I thought we could try to create a simple game uh it's going to be this limb game where you can control a character's limb so let's see if they these two models can now collaborate i think we're going to use Gemini 2.5 Pro uh to create a plan and then we're going to create use CL 3.7 to actually write some code and we can make them collaborate together to see what we can get from this so yeah let's just get into it and see how well this is going to work so we are in my gaming directory here you can see it also back here in cursor so uh what I want to do I want to go to claude right uh we can check so we are connected MCP yeah that's good uh okay we didn't need to do that but we can clear this so let's do a prompt here now so I'm going to come up with a prompt that's going to try to create this limb game uh you will see what I mean when we get into it uh but I'm going to ask it to specifically tell Gemini to make the plan for this but first let me just show you so uh this is kind of the style QVOP if you remember this game so this is the game where you kind of control the tie and the calves of this runner so you need to try to remove all of these to make it him go forward i really remember this game it's pretty cool so that is kind of what we got to reference so I'm just going to copy this qw uh that kind of is the cursor the the keyboard controls right so let's do a prompt now okay so today we are going to create a game uh it's going to be uh like the famous QWOP uh limb runner game so everything is going to try to clone that game uh I want to use uh 3JS uh but it's going to be of like a 2D game with some 3D elements so what I want you to do is to ask Gemini to come up with a plan how we can actually create this game okay so when we send this now of course this prompt is going to be a bit rewritten by Claude so we're going to see how that turns out you can see here create a detailed implementation plan for developing a QWOP style Limrunner game using 3JS primarily 2D with 3D elements yeah I think this is a good rewrite project structure mechanics physic implementation and yeah so now we're gonna send this request over to Gemini 2.5 Pro and hopefully we get like a good plan back and cloud 3.7 that is running on cloud code is going to execute this plan for us so let's just wait till we get a response from our MCP server here and then we can continue building out this uh game okay so you can see here we got the response back from Gemini detailed implementation plan for this QWOP style runner game we have the game concept technological stack we have some 240 extra lines and based on the Gemini response here is the full plan uh I'm just going to say uh great let's uh write the code for this uh game right okay development phases no we just going to do it now we're not going to wait six seven weeks 8 weeks to create this game that was crazy okay so we created some structure so I'm just going to let this run now let's go initialize and yeah but we have something back uh let's take a look and see if we can develop this further okay so let's try this now so we can do an npm rundev i'm just going to do it from here npn rundev okay and let's open this QWOP Runner so let's try this now okay so uh this was not easy it doesn't seem like the controller is working and we're starting up in the air here no the limbs is not working so let's try to fix this so let's do let's do a prompt here okay so the game is loading but uh we cannot control any of the limbs using qwop so uh I want you to send some code snippets to Gemini and try to work it out together how we can fix this so I want to see if we can actually send some uh relevant code snippets over to Gemini in the prompt here to kind of work together because it doesn't have the context right that 3.57 3.7 has here so let's see if we can create this prompt here yeah so here we are sending the code snippets great so now this is being sent to the 2.5 Pro API and this should give it more context so we're going to focus on figure out why the joints are responding to key presses so yeah perfect this looks very good this is exactly kind of what I wanted to see that we can update and they can kind of collaborate using this okay so I went ahead I tested out this QWOP and I can see the hips has almost like a full range of motions so I said uh consult with Gemini again to figure out how we can do this in our game and here is kind of response we're going to do a revolute joint to a spherical joint okay that is what we have right a ball joint in our hip uh so let's see if that makes some changes because it was so hard to walk with our character when we had this uh yeah we couldn't really cross cross the legs so I want to see if this changes anything okay so you can see this is where we are at now it's not too bad but we fall over all the time because we don't have any balance okay we hit the ground but you can see I think we're just going to add some arms and maybe that helps with our balance so let's run that and I'll come back kind of hopefully we have the finished game okay so I think that's it uh I had a lot of fun playing around with this because I I was just adjusting parameters and there's a bunch of stuff you can adjust here so I'm going to put this on GitHub if you want to go in and adjust the physics yourself but let's see it now uh there's still uh more work we can do here but refresh this and you can see the issue we have is that it's not really standing up so if you zoom in a bit here you can see if we get a good start we can move forward uh but it's very difficult right because we can't really recover uh but I'm not going to spend any more time working on this now if we get a good start like this you can see we can kind of move forward but it's not easy and I fall over all the time uh but we have a bit much too much power now this is the way I found out we can do this so we can just walk on the knees forward like this if we spam like this but we can't really stand up almost okay can we get over this no we got stuck here uh but it is pretty cool though and there's there's a lot of stuff you can adjust so you can see I can kick the leg here uh but uh it needs a bit more work on the physics part you can see we're walking what is happening here uh but it is pretty fun though okay so we got over we almost flew there because if we you can see we can get a lot of speed because we have a bit much power on now whoa but we can't really recover right when we first fall over uh but it is pretty fun so uh I'm probably going to just push this to Versel or something if I did you can see it in the the link uh below but uh I gotta say I was very happy with our uh MCP server and kind of the collaboration between Claude and Gemini so this is something I'm going to explore uh a bit more I think because there could be some interesting stuff we can do with this so yeah I hope you enjoyed this hope this gave you some inspiration and we speaks again probably", "duration(in seconds)": 549.0, "region": "US"}}

also expect the White House to try to reassure folks who are sitting there looking at their 401ks uh going down and down and down uh this is a White House that came in trying to get federal workers to retire by the hundreds of thousands but uh it's tough to make the argument that you should retire if your retirement accounts are getting throttled which is what is happening right now uh so we expect we hope for answers to uh all of these Curiosities uh any minute John A2 Peter Ducey that was the fox host saying what frankly most Americans are saying which is that it's not great that the White House is both cutting the jobs of tens if not hundreds of thousands of federal employees while at the same time ensuring that the environment they're fired into is as bad as humanly possible and look I get that Donald Trump wants to pretend that everything is fine and that these moves are somehow unnecessary evil to get the economy to where we need it to be but hear me out here Trump took office with a 4% un employment rate historically low the US economy was the strongest in the world the stock market was at a record high inflation was Cooling and was in the 2 to 3% range with two being the target so that stuff was all good the problem was the cost of goods and by the way that's no secret Trump himself admitted that the high cost of grow for example was literally why he won the election I won on two things the border and more than immigration you know they like to say immigration I break it down more to the Border but I want On the Border and I went on groceries it's very simple word groceries like almost you know who uses the word I started using the word the groceries when you buy apples when you buy bacon when you buy eggs they would double and triple the price over a short period of time and I want an election based on that we're going to bring those prices way down so the issue is that costs were too high and yet now think about what Trump has done since he's been president he's launched trade Wars with all of our Trading Partners well it's all well and good that Trump wants to frame this as some hit to foreign countries but tariffs don't get paid by foreign countries they get paid by Americans they are a tax paid by American consumers to the American government we foot the bill so you've got a president who is elected with a mandate to lower costs whose First Act in office is to make everything more expensive and by the way it's not just the fact that costs are rising the way that Trump is wielding these tariffs is also causing a ton of economic inst ility and you know what the worst thing possible is for the stock market instability which is why the markets have now entered correction territory and even Trump himself refuses to rule out the possibility of a recession and I want to ask you about Ukraine and the blow up the other day with with zalinski let me stay on the economy for a moment because there are rising worries about a Slowdown you've got the Atlanta Federal Reserve saying we're going to have a contraction in the first quarter look I know that you inherited a mess and you said that the other been here are you expecting a recession this year here um I hate to predict things like that there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big we're bringing wealth back to America that's a big thing and there are always periods of it takes a little time it takes a little time but I don't I think it should be great for us I mean I think it should be great it's going to be great ultimately for the farmer this is a guy who would try to sell sand in the desert the guy would sell water to a fish and so for even this guy not to unequivocally help himself and shut down Maria bomo and instead waffle on the idea of a recession should really tell you something about the economic environment that he's created in fact that's the point that Fox's Jess garlo brought up here even the strongest allies of the president don't like these tariffs they might think it's possible to use them smaller levels 5% 10% but the Tariff Whiplash is d destroying us you look at the market tanking and I thought Peter Ducey had a great Point earlier on today our very own peter Ducey where he said they want federal workers to take the buyout they want them to retire but they're sinking their retirement accounts and Caroline levit is standing up there at the podium and she's just either she doesn't know how a tariff works or she's lying to the people she said tariffs are a tax hike on foreign countries and a tax cut for the American people and then a reporter I think from the AP so they got back in the room said have you ever paid a tariff I have they don't get charged on foreign countries and then she went trumpi in she goes I think it's insulting that you're trying to test my knowledge on economics meaning now we've got two hosts on Fox's air who are acknowledging objective reality about the situation that Trump has created White House Press Secretary Carolyn levit was asked about the prospect of recession and this is the best that she could come up with it seems that the read on the president's policies in is one in which they do not have confidence in his trade tariffs policy they do not have confidence in what the president said to Fox News over the weekend that he didn't rule out the idea of a recession what is your read in terms of the decline that we've seen over the last week and a half in financial markets well I think there's actually a lot of reason to be confident and many people do feel confident just look at the nearly $2 trillion in private investment that this president has secured look at the comments made by the CEO of Apple one of the biggest companies in this world who said that he is bullish on the future of American innovation under the leadership of President Trump look at CEO confidence according to the conference board measure of CEO confidence in q1 2025 under the leadership of this President it jumped to its highest level in three years from cautious optimism to confident optimism ah well if CEO confidence is good then I guess we're fine right as long as the Millionaires and billionaires feel happy then what could possibly be wrong I have said this before and I'll say it again this Administration does not care about you unless you are wealthy the tax cut that they are ushering through will give the top 1% a tax cut that'll be a staggering 70 times higher than what the middle class gets 70 Times Higher the stat that Carolyn levit cites to explain away a tanking economy is that corporate CEOs still feel good which by the way I'm sure has nothing at all to do with the fact that they're about to get a tax cut the budget that Republicans are about to pass will cut $880 billion from Medicaid and 200 30 billion from Food Stamps which the poorest Americans rely on all to offset $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for the rich do they have to tattoo their tax brackets on their faces before everyone in this country begins to realize exactly who these people are fighting for and look the reason that I'm covering clips from Fox News including Peter Ducey and Jessica tarv is because Fox and right-wing media more broadly have been really effective at insulating their audiences from the truth in the rare instances where the truth does break through even on that very Network it's worth promoting and the reality is that Trump and Republicans are going to have a really difficult time convincing Their audience that the economy somehow isn't bad when we can all see the stock market we can when we can all see our 401ks when we can all see the cost of groceries and rent and housing and lumber and food and pharmaceuticals and Cars and auto parts and electronics all go up all of the prot Trump coverage in the world is not going to help them explain it away and in the same way the Democrats lost in 2024 in part because even non-political Americans could still feel the economy and wanted to punish the people in charge this is the same situation working to the detriment now of the GOP so you can try to spin the truth all you want but at some point reality is going to catch up with you that is a lesson that fox Trump and Republicans are all learning in real [Music] time before you go first if you enjoy this content and

China is also exploring ways to become self-sufficient long-term through embracing new technology and better farming education.\n\nWSJ explains why growing its own grains has been such a struggle for China and how it has been trying to wean itself off of its reliance on U.S. corn production.\n\n0:00 China’s corn demand\n1:01 China’s struggles\n2:57 International partnerships\n5:59 Self-sufficiency\n\nU.S. vs. China\nThis original video series explores the rivalry between the two superpowers’ competing efforts to develop the technologies that are reshaping our world.\n\n#China #Food #WSJ", "tags": "u.s. vs china, chinas economy, china farming, corn, corn production, corn farming, america corn exports, u.s. corn exports, u.s. farming industry, largest producer of corn, crop production, farming, corn animal feed, agriculture, farming technology, how to grow corn, corn agriculture, china corn harvester, china farming technology, tons per acre, arable land, urbanization, soil pollution, fertilizer, china fertilizer, brazil corn, brazil china, gmo corn, soy beans, wonews", "script": "- [Narrator] China\nimported over $5 billion of U.S. corn last year even though it's the world's\nsecond largest producer of the crop. The world's top producer is the U.S. And most of the corn these\ncountries are producing isn't even eaten by people. About 75% of China's\ncorn and 40% of the U.S.' is used for animal feed. Livestock get fatter\nwhen they're fed corn, and China's growing middle class is eating more and more meat. China now needs about\n250 million metric tons of corn per year. So much corn that it has\nto import millions of tons from other countries. And now China has begun\nworking to cut its reliance on foreign corn,\nparticularly from the U.S. - Any country that's trying\nto maintain livestock, be it cows, pigs, what have\nyou, they need to have corn. - [Narrator] But China's farms\nlike far behind the U.S., which is a major concern\nfor its food security. Here's why growing its own grains has been such a struggle for China and how it's been trying to\nwean itself off U.S. corn, which could leave a significant gap in America's export market. U.S. farmers are much more\nsuccessful at growing corn than their counterparts in China. The U.S. department of\nagriculture estimates that China's corn fields yielded less than three\ntons per acre last year versus nearly five in the U.S. - It's widely believed from\nthe folks that I talked to that the U.S. has the superior soil, the superior farming techniques. - [Narrator] The U.S. has\nsignificantly more arable land than China, and the arable\nland that China does have is decreasing due to urbanization. China's soil is also heavily polluted. A 2014 report found nearly 1/5\nof the country's arable land was contaminated with heavy metals. China is currently conducting\na national soil survey to see the extent of the issue. A second key advantage for U.S. farmers is their growing practices. To try and grow more, Chinese farmers use massive\namounts of fertilizer, more than four times the global average. Many Chinese farmers are\nusing fertilizer inefficiently and polluting the larger\necosystem in the process. A third issue for Chinese farmers, their seeds are about 20\nyears behind U.S. technology. Many in China are suspicious\nof genetically modified crops, but the government has worked to overcome that skepticism. Even in its recent push to embrace genetically modified corn, China only allowed a tiny\nfraction of its corn fields to be planted with\ngenetically modified seeds, according to reports. So China has turned to the U.S. for corn. While its banned domestic farmers from growing genetically modified corn due to public opposition, China has still imported\ngenetically modified corn to feed animals. But as tensions have escalated\nbetween the two countries, China has put more effort into finding alternative trade\npartners to get the resource, adding competition to the market. - They're in the process of setting up kind of their own trade network that can support their\npopulation and their economy, and do so in a way where\nthey're free of U.S. influence, free of Western influence in general. - [Narrator] Namely, this\nmeans turning to Brazil, which is right behind the U.S. and China when it comes to corn production. - For China, they're in\nthe process of seeking out the countries that can\nhandle their demand, and which is why Brazil is a key partner that they're developing a\nstronger partnership with. It's because Brazil is able to grow as a corn-producing country, and they see that growth as supportive for their demand going forward. - [Narrator] For a long time, Brazil was known for having\na volatile corn supply, but the country's now\nproducing far more corn than ever before, increasing\nhow many acres are planted and growing a second crop of corn after farmers harvest soybeans. It hasn't had to do everything on its own. Foreign businesses have been investing in Brazil's agriculture for decades. Chinese companies have spent billions to get involved in the\ngrowing Latin American market and everything from seeds to\nprocessing and transportation. Things have shifted even further\nsince the war in Ukraine. For years, China was getting\nlots of its corn there. Ukraine is one of the world's\nlargest corn producers, but its corn production\nhas fallen significantly in the past few years. The war has made it harder for farmers to get financing for corn\nseeds and fertilizer, and some farmland has been unusable due to occupation or mines. So China has doubled down on\nits relationship with Brazil. Last year, China signed an agreement to allow significantly more\ncorn imports from the country. The result, Brazil may surpass the U.S. in corn exports this year. - Brazil is receiving increased\nmarket share of exports that used to be in the U.S.' domain. There's competitions for prices, who has the most competitive prices, and Brazil often wins that. - [Narrator] Because Brazil\nstill has lots of room to expand its corn growing acreage, it could soon surpass the\nU.S. in corn production. - There's a lot of room to grow, and that's what they're doing. They're aggressively growing. - [Narrator] This could\npose significant competition for the U.S., especially in\nlight of other circumstances facing the country's corn market. The U.S. is currently\nfacing a trade dispute with its second biggest\ncorn customer, Mexico, which plans to ban\ngenetically modified corn by the end of 2023. The country says this is to preserve heirloom varieties of corn\nthat grow domestically, but it's a big deal since more\nthan 90% of U.S. grown corn is genetically modified. - Export markets are always a top concern. If China is no longer purchasing or exports in general are to drop off, then the price that\nfarmers are gonna receive at the grain elevators for their crop have the potential to sink. For farmers that are already operating on really thin margins,\nthat's very difficult. And a lot of times when\nthis kind of thing happens, there's some farmers that\nsimply cannot overcome that. - [Narrator] U.S. farmers could\npotentially sell more corn to ethanol plants that\ncould use it to make fuel, but losing the export market could significantly lower prices. - They wouldn't be able to\ncover the amount of volume that China and exports in general take up from the U.S. producers. They wouldn't be able to cover that just through ethanol alone. - [Narrator] Ultimately,\nChina aims to grow all the basic grains it needs, whether that's corn,\nwheat, rice, or soybeans. But corn is just one crop where China's crop production falls short. The country also relies\non foreign soybeans. It imported over $16 billion\nworth from the U.S. last year. Soybeans and corn often\ngrow on the same land, but corn is more productive. China's average soybean yield per acre is less than 1/3 that of\ncorn, and is about 40% less than the United States'\naverage soybean yield for the same plot. Some Chinese researchers\nhave been urging farmers to adopt new planting methods that could allow them to\ngrow both soy and corn, but they worry farmers prefer to just stick with what\nthey're already doing. Experts believe China\ncould grow self-sufficient in corn production by\nthe end of the decade. The recombination of\nbetter planting practices, using cornbread to maximize growth, and improving the soil quality. But that would require\nembracing new technology and farmer education. - They would have to\ngrow significantly more in order to be self-sufficient\nthe way that the U.S. is, and they would have a\nlong way to go to do that. - [Narrator] For the foreseeable future, China will probably need to keep importing large amounts of corn if\nit wants to keep using it in animal feed, but soon, that may no longer\nmean buying from the U.S. - China is in the position where they don't have\nenough to feed their people, which is why they import from outside. And they've been reliant on us as the primary corn producer in the world even if they really don't\nwant to do business with us. That's why they're\nbuilding trade agreements that you can essentially\ngo around the U.S. The U.S. doesn't really\nhave an alternative to China in terms of the buying\npower that they have. - [Narrator] Farmers\nhave seen what can happen when China stops buying\nU.S. agricultural goods. When China sharply reduced orders for products like corn\nand soybeans in 2018, farms hit record levels of debt despite the U.S. government\nresponding with billions in aid. If China stops buying us corn again and moves its business\nto countries like Brazil, farmers would need to find a replacement. But having to replace a\n$5 billion export market could be a major problem for farmers who are already\ngetting buy on thin margins.

been telling a Senate Finance Committee the tariffs had to happen i think we'll find that American businesses are much more competitive when they have open markets overseas uh people talk about the high cost of doing business in America and manufacturing in America and growing in America but when we cannot access foreign markets or we face barriers overseas that that increased costs and it makes it difficult to be competitive globally and even domestically we have to reshore manufacturing this is an important way to do it we can have tariff protection as we as we get rid of the trade deficit reshort manufacturing and as other countries open their markets they can potentially have a different arrangement that helps us as we try to have reciprocal trade and get rid of the deficit and get back to being a producing economy it's where we need to be the US trade representative Jameson Greer addressing a Senate committee now welcome to the program the assistant secretary for commerce at the International Trade Administration during Donald Trump's first term welcome to the program great to be with you thank you for having me NASA good to have you here nazak Nikatar now can I ask you first uh this basic question on China how far is that do you believe America it might be prepared to go to escalate this conflict with China is there no limit do you think should there be no limit i mean that's a great question and that's top of uh a lot of business's minds and I think the president is really willing to go all the way and the reason is is is pretty simple um ever since China joined the the World Trade Organization even before that um it really worked to decimate uh the US industrial base and frankly the manufacturing sectors of of all of its trading partners and but just right upon China's entry into the WTO I was on the front line I was at the commerce department back then we just saw a massive increase in dumped goods into the United States subsidized goods more and more market manipulative behavior cartel behavior over capacity and then at the same time eroding our industrial base pre preventing us from having access to China's markets this issue has been going on and has resulted in the systematic hollowing out of the domestic industrial base that's obviously so critical for not only the US economy but then the applications for national security compounded by IP theft and all of those things you know well so the president had to take action i I frankly no country has stood up to China and the way that China's predatory practices merits a country standing up to it right so I completely recognize your your conviction that it's right to uh to try to confront China when it comes to unfair unfair trade i I I hear that completely i wonder how far it would be wise to go down this route because we're now seeing that sort of tit fortat retaliatory battle i mean is it conceivable that that the president would you think it'd be wise to try to go to a a place where Chinese goods are banned from the American market because there are those who say that would just lead to global recession well and there's a danger to that too all of our critical supply chains um that we need to make pretty much every real like manufactured good in the United States is controlled by China so it's not just critical minerals it's other upstream raw materials so yes absolutely can China crater America's economy tomorrow absolutely obviously as you pointed out that's going to have massive spillover impact on on on the rest of the world at the same time are we going to get to a point where we're exchanging blows and the US government has no choice but to start sanctioning China and the Chinese central banks right that also will certainly accelerate and lead to a global recession so things are getting pretty uh heated things are getting pretty dangerous uh we're hoping that we don't go you know I I think we're almost to the brink um I hope that we don't go off the cliff uh but you know President Trump is really angry and look Xi Jinping is not the same leader he was in 2018 he is flexing his muscles back because he's consolidated power supply chains he's ready to fight to the bitter end the question is how far is Trump willing to go yeah well it is and I wonder how far how far because President Trump is in control of what President Trump is doing and thinking no one can be quite sure where that's going to go next and you talk about going off the off the edge off the edge of an economic cliff that's it's quite an alarming idea idea of this a lot of markets hate what's going on what can you say to re to investors who are worried about this economic fallout i think there there's a couple of key points um I think the that Trump fundamentally believes that the Chinese uh the Chinese economy needs the US economy to survive so Trump fundamentally believes that the Chinese will retreat maybe they will maybe they won't but I think um once the economic costs to the U to the US markets to US businesses hit that po that tipping point and they're starting to get there I think the president will understand that um he still can hit back China harder but he may need to pivot strategy and I think yeah pivot strategy i mean and you're you're a big supporter of the president completely understand that and your prediction is as the the heat becomes unbearable the president will look for an off-ramp a way to to back down he'll call it a victory but he'll be looking for a way to back away i wouldn't necessarily back say back down because he's a New Yorker he's never going to back down right but he what he has always demonstrated is sort of flexibility and strategy he's going to try a tactic if it doesn't work he's going to try another strategy he might work more closely with other countries to isolate China economically uh but he's not going to back down it's just augment or pivot strategy from from the path that he's taking but certainly as a New Yorker he is not going to back down he doesn't believe he ever he does have to back down okay the staring contest goes on and what about the the plan to force companies to reshore their production to bring bring jobs and work plants back to the United States of America a report today I was just looking at before the the program a major firm Lux Share Precision Industry it assembles the iPhone and other Apple products and it's just announced that it's keeping its operations where they are in Vietnam that's despite a 46% tariff and the company says it's because the cost of the American workforce and the lack of a developed supply chain make it not possible to come back that's discouraging isn't it to this strategy well yes and no so I mean you know the the the administration understands that you know Vietnam is a non-market economy country and the uh Communist Party of Vietnam basically controls the Vietnamese economy and and pulls levers to make Vietnam to manufacture in Vietnam cheaper to undermine US and other global interests so it Vietnam is not sort of uh viewed in a great way by the current administration they understand the problems now I know a lot of manufacturing has moved there but to other point of the question and I don't think that manufacturers who've located operations there off uh moving out of China are going to find that that's really a great long-term strategy just for the reasons I explained but you know since your question is is is everything going to come back to the United States certainly not i think on some level the president and his administration understand that um they want to bring certainly back as much as they can to the United States but let's be you know realistic about it uh we aren't going to have the energy to support every single manufactured item we're not going to have the workforce to support it and obviously these things take to have lots of lead time required right and so I think we're going to get to a place where we have road growing and expanded trade with our trading partners as we sort of negotiate our way out of this friction so that we basically have uh more of our supply chains in a healthier trading ecosystem and then again as much as can actually be on shore to the United States all right naza great to talk to you naza Nikatar there a member of the trade team under Donald Trump's first term in office", "duration(in seconds)": 520.0, "region": "US"}}

playing this game with galani because galani will just start peppering his body until those hands start to come down and he can land a massive head kick I thought galani had big deltoids look at the bunch of bananas on Umar Kan those shoulders are huge yeah I think Rich Franklin said that Kane wasn't that big but maybe next to you he might not be that big Mr Franklin but Kane looks gigantic in

shirt but never mind that i'm here to answer your difficult [Music] questions no I don't think I do i I quite like a good con a conspiracy theory especially if it's well thought out so it's made to stack up even though you know it's almost certainly complete cobblers i like conspiracy theories about people never went to the moon i know they did i've seen the photographs of the remains of the lunar modules on the moon taken by Japanese and I think Indian spacecraft mapping the surface of the moon and the idea that it could be covered up would be more remarkable and harder than actually doing it um but I've I've watched some conspiracy theories about moonlandings being fake and about nuclear weapons being fake that have been extremely well thought out by people who perhaps should really be authors of thrillers because they make it almost convincing and I I like that because that suggests somebody's put a lot of work and imagination into it rather than just repeated some vague guff about that lizards are actually ruling the world or one of those things they're just they're just rubbish but a well constructed conspiracy theory is it you know it's a yarn and yarns are [Music] good well they'd all be useful in that they're my friends and that is a useful quality in itself specific jobs i mean believe it or not I think following the zombie apocalypse Richard Hammond would be quite a useful person to know because he's actually quite handy he's quite robust he's a bit deranged but you can sort of work around that [Music] um so what what are my friends good at i can think of several friends who are good at making just making life more peaceful men and women I know who who who you like having there in a big group because they sort of bring a a level my my friends can get quite rowdy and argumentative but there are certain people who have a calming effect i'm not going to name them because they might watch this and then if I leave some out they'll say \"But I have a calming effect and you haven't mentioned me um in fact this question is designed to end these very friendships that you talk of i hope I'm reasonably patient and you know I'm not tough by any means but I'm I hope I'm robust enough to endure some hardship and adversity uh and I'm reasonably practical so I can you know light fires and cook food and make things out of wood use tools um sing songs tell jokes etc [Music] oh I'm sure we could find a use of Jeremy Clarkson in the zombie apocalypse um target practice no uh I mean he he's Jeremy and I are very different people um we're not we're not sort of natural buddies but I actually quite enjoy his company because he's he's a not an opponent but he's a he's a great opposite and we can sort of bounce off each other quite well i've done some extremely long car journeys with him such as to the North Pole famously um and how long were we together sitting in a car i think it was sort of two weeks we didn't have any crosswords or fallout we had some very entertaining conversations about things like sandwich fillings um and made up you know little jokes and little stories like you do when you're with people you know well on a long car journey so I think he'd be good for that he'd be he'd be he'd be an entertainment first and foremost which you need uh because you know society has always needed theater jugglers clowns jesters minstrels town criers acrobats TV presenters that sort of thing society would be rather empty without it i take Lucy Brown i hadn't mentioned Lucy Brown which is very remiss of me i think Lucy Brown would be very useful in the zombie apocalypse or the postz zombie apocalypse cuz she could make a vlog about it behind the scenes of the zombie apocalypse with Lucy [Music] Brown yes I would always want to survive i can't imagine of maybe it's because my imagination isn't good enough but I and they obviously do exist but I can't imagine a set of circumstances bad enough that would make me say well I'm just going to end this you know opening the door of the lunar module on the moon type moment i don't think I could do that i'd fight the dying of the light to the end [Music] oh I would I haven't read very much science fiction although I did read a bit when I was younger when I used to read a lot before I followed Philip Larkin's advice and I think I probably read about the past more because most things are actually set in the past even things we were doing earlier on today are now in the past so if I retell them as an anecdote they're in the past [Music] a study of reading habits when getting my nose in a book cured most things short of school he goes on about reading books and about how it all goes stale for him and at the end he says \"Get stewed books are a load of crap.\" He was a miserable bugger but an extremely good poet uh yes certainly in the past I read a huge amount of poetry and it probably arrested my development in some ways i was actually that rather nerdy bloke who would sit under a tree with a slim volume of verse like Omar Cayam here with a loaf of bread beneath the bow a flask of wine a book of verse and thou beside me singing in the wilderness [Music] because I could have been doing something constructive instead of reading medieval English lyrics some of which I can still recite by heart it's terrible really uh I sing of a maiden who is mateless king of all kings for her son she chose he came so still where his mother lay as due in April that fallth on the spray and so it goes on i can do the whole thing but I won't bore you [Music] top Gear never actually existed i don't see how you would argue that no I've just thought that was the first thing that came into my head and I'm not sure how you could argue that either um a conspiracy theory wow i mean they're quite I mean they tend the good ones tend to be about big things like I mean not lizards so much but um the Illuminati we didn't really go to the moon there isn't really any such thing as nuclear weapons um the world is being controlled by a secret order of people who want you to own nothing and be happy those are the ones so you'd have to think of something quite big to make a good conspiracy theory let's let's have a think um I mean some conspiracy theories are very ugly like the Holocaust deniers and so on um some are some are quite good fun like the world is actually being overrun by invisible lizards or whatever uh what would be a good that's a very good question what's a good conspiracy theory yes I I'll have to come back to you on a conspiracy theory because I think that's too difficult i'd have to think i'll get back to you viewers at some point in the future with a conspiracy theory but in the meantime thank you for watching and I hope

sum vs dollar cost averaging, stock market, how to dollar cost average, seth moran", "script": "question for you is it smarter to invest a little bit at a time with dollar cost averaging or just dump all your money at once with a lump sum strategy because if you're sitting on cash or even just wondering what to do with your paycheck every month this one decision could cost you thousands of dollars over the long run the numbers emphatically say one way is clearly better than the other but I'm going to tell you why I prefer the complete opposite so stick around and we can go over both and you can decide which one is better for you so let's get into it first up dollar cost averaging what is it well it's simple you invest a fixed amount of money say $500 at regular intervals like every week or every month no matter what the Market's doing when the prices are low you're buying more stock cuz it's cheaper when the prices are high you're buying less stock because the price is actually now more expensive per share now over time that could lower your average cost per share from a vwap or volume weighted average price perspective particularly if the market isn't just going straight up now it's automatic it's consistent and it takes motion out of the equation so is it better than lumpsum investing which essentially is taking all your investable money whether that's 1K 100K or even over a millionar and investing it all at once right into the market now the answer may surprise me lump suum investing outperforms dollar cost averaging about 2third of the time according to a 2012 study done by Vanguard lumpsum investing outperforms dollar cost averaging about 66 to 70% of the time by an average of about 2 to 3% in total return over a 10-year period now that 2 to 3% might not sound huge but over 10 20 30 years it compounds significantly even after 10 years if you invested 100K in the same underlying assets the performance can be significant you can see the lump suum strategy here capturing all the gains because they were fully invested while the DCA strategy missed out on the gains by spreading out their risk and not being fully invested that 3% annual difference results in $57,000 after just a decade purely from compounding now you can visually see the difference in the blue shaded area of the chart that's because markets historically go up over time there is a long bias to the market the earlier you're in the longer your investment is able to compound now at dollar cost averaging you are leaving cash on the sidelines so it's not yielding anything other than the interest in your brokerage or your savings account so your investment is not able to achieve compound growth at its full potential but this is where it twists a bit dollar cost averaging isn't about maximizing every dollar it's about Building A system that helps you actually take action because let's be honest how many people stay on the sidelines scared to get in or waiting for the perfect entry price stricken with the case of analysis paralysis in this case dollar cost averaging wins because Behavior beats map so how much should you DCA every month well if you can swing it the professionals advise about 15 to 20% of your gross monthly income but the real answer is whatever you can afford what you cannot afford to do is stay uninvested and sitting on cash automated make it boring why because boring gets rich and if you're investing through a 401k or an IRA every month you're already dollar cost averaging you're winning despite see of red you've been swimming it in the past month stay calm carry on keep investing on a regular basis because that is the key so let's go over a couple examples example one this is one where dollar cost averaging works perfectly you invest $500 a month over 6 months now the market dips Midway through and then rebounds you bought more shares at the low and less at the High and when prices rise again your average cost is lower and your gains are higher see that's the perfect DCA setup now let's go to another example in this example dollar cost averaging will underperform lump sum so you take the same $500 a month but the market keeps on Rising each month you're buying fewer and fewer shares if You' invested a lump sum up front you'd have earned more so in this case both strategies are making money but lump sum is to clear winner now the big question I get asked all the time is do I have to stick to regular intervals or can I just buy on dips they technically dollar cost averaging is all about consistency but yes if you're not watching every tick of the market then I would tell you stick to the game plan inv that's the same amount every month eyes closed Left Foot Right Foot carry on that's it but if you're a stock jockey and you're always tuned in current events and you're trading consistently then no I would suggest a more hybrid approach and this is kind of more of the camp that I would fall in I call it tactical DCA so you invest a set amount each month and you keep a little cash on the side and when the market drops 5 to 10% or more you get in there and you buy the dip you get the discipline of dollar cost averaging and the upside of opportunistic buying so you don't just fall into the Trap of waiting around for the perfect dip That Never Comes that's called Market timing or being Dr Wall Street and it's where most people lose by missing out so is dollar cost averaging the smartest way to invest well for me it makes things mechanical and habitual with less emotion you don't have to worry about timing and if you're a new investor it's the perfect way to safely and comfortably get involved with investing again though it depends on you and if your nerves about volatility and you need structure then dollar cost averaging is your best friend now if you've got a lump sum of money that's sitting around and you've got the stomach for some ups and downs the statistical data is behind you and says go all in my view here is you have to know what the theme of the market is now if it's a bare Market or volatile market then dollar cost averaging is a better option because you're investing on a regular basis and you're catching those dips if the Market's on a bull run then lump suum investing is the best bet because it gets you money in the market quickly with momentum and then the power of comp finding interest can begin but whatever you do pick a plan and stick with it cuz that's how real wealth is built thanks for watching I'm stth Moran I spent 20 years on a street professionally

What does a healthy economy \neven look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a\npretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most\neconomists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, \nparticularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief\nthat growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,\nhealthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve\nturned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow\nforever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,\nin our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor\nof growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend\nhad gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something \ntries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,\nfor some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running\ninto severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s\nby US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number \nto measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons\nof steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him \nto do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together\nin one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—\nbut he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can\nscarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about \nthe unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value\nthat’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow \nof economic value. It tells us nothing about the\nliving world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order\nto create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,\nof this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it \nin their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race\nof pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can\nkeep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple\nfrom using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,\nand minerals and plastics, and we can use less \nof the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: \never rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; \nwould that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,\nof ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce \nour use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st\ncentury prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut \nwith the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,\nhumanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle\nof that picture. So in the hole, \nin the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people \ndon’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough\nfood or health care, or education or housing or gender equality\nor political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social\nfoundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can\nlead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, \nit absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways \nthat invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists\nwho started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,\nand the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,\nand the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, \nwe have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent \non this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources \nin such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond\nthe living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life\nsupporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s \nan inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s\nresource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down\nthis planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,\nyou get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress\nis fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line\nexponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news \nall the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is \nthat we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, \nenough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— \nhave enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor \nfrom the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking\nchance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.", "duration(in seconds)": 365.0, "region": "US"}}

gram", "script": "[Music] hello everyone this is a very easygoing Vlog there's not going to be any music or fancy editing cuz I really just want to share with you guys what my days are really like so the first order of business for today and one that I'm really really excited about is that one of my PRS for an open source project has been approved some long-term viewers might remember that about a year ago I made a fix for a physics engine while I was working on a game in one of my videos without going into too much detail typically in a game with physics your physics engine runs at a different frame rate than your rendering thread and that means that often times you have to deal with interpolation meaning you have to find the in between positions of every object for every frame on the rendering thread and in most games the physics engine actually runs much faster than the rendering thread so for example if you're playing a game at 60 FPS the physics engine might be working under the hood at 240 FPS this makes the simulation a lot more accurate but my PR was fixing the case when actually the rendering thread was spiking in fps and it was going faster than the physics engine so I really hope that my PR gets merged sometime in the near future but anyhow the next order of business is to fix picks a few small edge cases in the book that I'm working on about software engineering the book has a lot of these interactive illustrations showing how various different concepts in software engineering work so in this one for example I'm trying to illustrate how streams work but there is a problem notice what happens when I switch tabs all of these little shapes become synchronized but why all of these animations implement the game Loop using the request animation frame function but did you know this function doesn't get called if you navigate to another tab it's like a browser optimization tactic so when you navigate back all the shapes that have gone off screen from left to right they get reset at the same time to their starting position and they become synchronized so the solution for me was to randomize the starting position as well so even if they appear back at the same time they're all in different places and it all works as expected so let's test it out if I navigate away you can see the old ones are still being synchronized but the new ones are appearing randomly so I was pretty happy about that recently I've been using the cursor Editor to try out some of the AI features but I'm not so sure about it I had a particularly dumb task and it even failed with that let me show you some of the code samples in the book are C++ but when writing them I forgot to escape the brackets in the include statements so I wanted to ask AI to Simply Escape them and it did so using backslash so I had to remind it to use HTML entities and then it gave me the classic AI response ah yes we should use HTML entities yes thank you so much for that AGI leap of intelligence but then it wasn't done yet it proceeded to change completely unrelated parts of the code base that have nothing to do with my prompt I don't know man this AGI thing maybe it's around the corner I just don't know which corner that is oh and by the way if you're curious about the book there is an early Access Link in the description all the animations and everything is hand coded and since I launched it I received so much positive feedback you can even get it with the source code all right so next I want to improve that proxy thing that I described in my previous video which is kind of like middleware software that allows me to implement authentication and other shared features for the book and some of my other projects it's written in node and now that I have all the basic functionality already implemented I'm working on improving the logging the stability and testability of the whole project in this second part of the video I'm going to leave a little bit longer more relaxed sections of coding but I'm going to make a few comments about some interesting things that I learned about node and testing for example I started using this pattern where instead of creating services in an object-oriented way I started passing all the dependencies of every single function as prams and you can just about see that in the function signature on the right here another interesting thing is that for basic tests like this you actually don't need a testing framework because node itself comes with an assertion library and all you got to do is write a simple test file and run it with TS node for [Music] [Music] example but of course when it comes to testing things like accessing the database and did you write the right query then it becomes a little tricky to do all by yourself and at that point it's useful to have like mock functions at which point it's better to have a testing framework because if you write that all by yourself as I tried here actually in this video you're going to find out that you're not even sure whether your test helpers are properly working and then the question becomes well who is testing your testing code so by all means if you find yourself in a similar situation it's still much better to use a testing framework [Music] speee spee speing [Music] [Music] we've been really lucky here in Oso Norway with a couple of really beautiful days just in time for Christmas holidays so for all of you who are celebrating I wish you merry Christmas and I'll leave you with a few beautiful shots that I managed to capture on a pretty

has always fascinated me not only is it the most delicious sounding programming language I've ever heard but some of my favorite childhood games like RuneScape and Minecraft were made using it it was created to let programmers write once and run everywhere meaning Java code automatically works on other operating systems without having to recompile which is truly a beautiful thing and ever since it's release in 1995 it has remained one of the most popular programming languages needless to say I've been anxious for a long time to try it out and see what I can do with it now I must confess when I was 12 before I even made video games I went to my local library and picked up this book called programming video games for the Evil Genius a pretty cheesy name for a book that was just about learning Java of course after skim reading a chapter or two and trying to copy the code I quickly became frustrated and completely gave up so fast forwarding almost 15 years later I think it's time for me to redeem myself and see if I can actually make a game from scratch using Java not scratch I mean Java you get you get what I'm saying so starting off on my Java Quest I did something that I haven't done in a while and that was actually taking a little Java course on my phone and by take a course I mean I just kind of did a couple levels to get a feel for what the syntax was like and honestly if you're a beginner or new to programming languages uh I feel like this is just like a good thing to do it just kind of gives you a general idea before you just start jumping into it anywh who after I was done getting familiar with the basics I downloaded Eclipse which is an IDE and just in case you don't know what that is it's basically just software that you use to code in but this one's specifically for Java and I seem to remember using an IDE called net beans as a kid but Eclipse seems a lot more popular now so I just figured I would go with the crowd after that I set off to create a simple hello world program which was pretty straightforward basically you just create a package and I named it Maine and then you create a class and I also called it main I know it's confusing just trust me on it after that I slapped in the classic system out print line hello world and there you go your first Java program I did it so after getting my feet wet I knew I was ready to start working on my real project instead of CR a little mini game like I normally do for these kinds of videos I want to do something I've been dreaming about for a while now and that's making an RPG and I'm not talking about rocket launchers here I mean like an old grindy RPG that you would play on the NES games like Dragon Quest and Earthbound Beginnings I don't know why but I find these games simplistic art style super strange characters and repetitive combat to be so Charming they always feel so empty yet so full of character at the same time so now we know what direction the game's going to take it's time for us to do something basic and that's just draw a window and no I'm not talking about getting out a box of crayons and drawing a house with a window I'm talking about that frame that you see on your desktop when you play a game luckily for us Java has its own built-in container class called jframe meaning our game can be built purely with Vanilla Java so I set up jframe and made some of the parameters any who after doing all that I was able to successfully draw a window and as you can tell I was very excited next I created two new classes entity and player I'm planning on making NPCs later on so creating an entity class allows me just to reuse that code for the player and NPC for example like drawing their Sprites or checking for collisions and speaking of Sprites I was able to load and draw the Sticky's image make a move around the screen so yay I should also point out that I found this wonderful tutorial series by rynow and it was beyond helpful he does a really good job explaining how all this works so if you want to know more about the nitty-gritty details and all the code definitely check it out next I want to dive into creating a tile map system this is something that has always been intimidating for me for some reason it turns out to be super easy essentially all you have to do is create a text file full of numbers the numbers represent different types of tiles like zero is water and like one is grass and two is sand then all you need to do is load the data into an array and then slap it into a for Loop boom you got yourself a tile map and that's great and all but how do you make a camera system so that the player like can move around a larger tile ma area well the trick is instead of moving the player you move the tile set after that I made an if statement to see what tiles were on screen that way I could save performance by only rendering what the player could see and last I created collisions so you couldn't just like walk on the water so there you go now as you can tell the artwork is looking a little rough around the edges and since 50% of RPGs is just artwork I felt like we probably should update this now my original idea was to create a vector art style inspired by Byron be's Pokemon world map illustrations I've been a big fan of his work for a while and thought an RPG could look Super Fresh in this style though I quickly realized that higher resolution Vector artwork wasn't going to scale well down into pixels so this led me to kind of just create this same style but using pixel art instead I thought the results of this were kind of cool but I personally felt like this missed that quirky charm that I wanted to emulate in my favorite NES RPGs so after a slightly iterative process and the use of the NES color palette I ended up with this my animal inspired RPG so with that done I got to work replacing and adding in all the new tiles and artwork I also found that pixel edit the pixel art software I use has a feature that lets you export tiles out as a text file essentially turning my art software into my level editor which was pretty sweet after this I felt like the sound aspect of the game needed to be addressed so I jumped into lab tur I generated a couple of different sounds and then added them to the game I especially love this door sound when you enter a house it just It's oddly satisfying for music I made it myself using beatbox which I haven't used before I was surprised how easy it was to pick up but uh my song's a little clunky so let me know what you think after that I created a pausing State system so you can eventually look at your inventory and view your stats and I also Drew this text onto the screen so that text is actually a font I also know that world maps are a pretty big deal in these types of RPGs so I jumped back into pixel edit and made this kind of smaller world map just as a test run to see how I liked it this also means I had to create a room transition system so you could go from towns to the Overworld right now there's only one town but I think it's it's pretty cool it's start starting to feel like an RPG at this point I knew it was probably time to add NPCs I mean they're such a critical part using that entity system I mentioned earlier was super easy and made adding these NPCs take no time at all and then I add a dialogue system so I could have Bears say weird things like this and with that we have a basic RPG structure we're still missing combat which is the most crucial part of the game but I want to save that for a future video because this was a project I just really enjoyed working on I can't explain it but making a game without a game engine is super satisfying it's difficult and frustrating especially when you know you could do it 10 times faster using something else but it's also really rewarding cuz you know that you made it yourself I have a lot of plans what I could do with this RPG in the future even just as a passion project please let me know if you like to see more of it if not I'll probably just continue to work on it on my own time overall I really enjoy Java I think this has probably been my favorite language I've used so far in this series I highly highly recommend you check out RN's tutorial series on Java it's unbelievably helpful it explains everything that I covered in this video pretty much and even if you're just mildly interested check it out also if you're wanting to learn how to code yourself and you don't know how to get started check out a word

Over the last few years, we have seen a significant rise in retail participation in India's booming equity markets. Up until last year, growth in India overtook major markets across the world. Here’s the S&P 500, and here’s India’s MSCI Index outpacing it. But recently, the market has taken a turn. India’s stock market is headed for \nthe worst month in a couple of years. Stocks in India have wiped out  over a trillion dollars from their market value. Despite the volatility, retail investors in the world’s most populous country are still pouring money into the market. I’m not worried at all about \nIndia’s current market downturn.  In fact, I see it as a very, very good opportunity.  This has regulators on edge, especially as unscrupulous opportunists exploit those new to trading. So, what’s led to this boom in everyday investors in India and why is it making regulators worried? First, let’s take a look at what’s behind the surge of retail investors jumping into India’s capital markets. If you look at the number of trading accounts, it has grown four-fold in the last five years and is now nearing 200 million accounts. And it’s not just about the number of sign-ups. Individual investors, together with mutual funds, own roughly 18% of India’s equity market and surpassed the share of foreign investors \nfor the first time since 2006. If you look at mutual funds, the equity assets under management that they’ve been holding has also grown more than four times in the last five years. India’s always had strong retail participation in its equity markets. If you look back 25 years ago, retail investors were the largest proportion of this market, except at that time, it was very, very rich Indians and large broker dealers. What you're seeing play out today is a more broad-based secular trend that in many ways defines \nthe financialization of savings in India. The country’s expanding middle class traditionally saved in real estate, precious metals, or cash. But, now... Indian households, including young Indians— which is now the largest demographic in the country— are preferring to put their earnings in \nbetter-yielding instruments like equities. They now know that they want to \ninvest toward their retirement. And so, their investment horizon is more long-term. Experts liken it to the US in the 80s and 90s after the introduction of the 401(k) retirement plan. A nascent desktop internet helped spread knowledge about investments to an eager American population. The mobile equivalent is alive in India today. The pace at which many countries access technology was a slow and gradual growth, from computers to then laptops to mobile phones. But in India, the vast majority got access to the internet \ndirectly through smartphones. Those have enabled them to go onto social media, learn about investing, get registered with discount brokers \nand start investing as soon as possible. Another important change was the introduction of EKYC. That stands for Electronic Know Your Customer, and it’s the next big catalyst behind India’s retail investor boom. With EKYC, instead of having to physically go to a brokerage \narmed with papers and ID cards, rookies could do it anywhere. Their IDs are already linked to a bank account and show their date of birth and home address. New investors just need to upload it, snap a selfie and sign on the dotted line.  Once the account is approved, trades can be made for as little as 100 rupees, or just over $1 USD. Apps like Zerodha contributed to that surge in sign-ups\nto trading accounts we saw earlier, one of which caught the attention\nof 23-year-old Joseph Schatz. As a young boy, I always wanted to find ways where I could make much higher returns for the money that I had. As soon as I turned 18, I started investing with Zerohda using the pocket money that I got in college. My stock market investments would be \naround 90 percent of my total assets. I choose companies which I personally know of, or at least I understand the business of. 60-70% of my investments are in the financial sector. My investment strategy on how I place my investments is that I go in with the potential that I'm going to  remove this fund maybe after 20 years. While investors like Joseph are betting \non the markets’ long-term potential, others may be distracted by what’s happening right now. Does the bull run in Indian stocks have further to run or are we looking at a pullback at this point? We saw earlier that Indian stocks overtook global peers for years since the start of the Covid pandemic. But look what happens when we extend that timeline into this year. We've seen a significant fall in India’s stock market indices, the benchmark indices, as well as in select stock prices.  The benchmark Nifty Index had fallen to about 16% from the top that we saw in September. So what’s caused that? Well, firstly, foreign investors. They’ve sold more than $15 billion worth of stocks. For a variety of reasons, China looked more interesting last year  because Chinese markets and equities \nhad become much cheaper on account of their economic downturn. In the meantime, India’s growth is also slowing, raising concerns that the consumption boom which contributed to India’s stock market surge is coming to an end. Another factor was that Indian companies \nbegan to look overvalued. Last year, total market value of the stock market in India reached a record high of 140% of its GDP – much more than the 12-year average of 86%. There are many small and mid-cap companies \nwho were coming to market to do IPOs but not with maybe the best of fundamentals \nunderlying their businesses. A case that grabbed a lot of attention was the IPO of Resourceful Automobiles Limited. The company operated just two dealerships and had an employee count of less than 10, and this issue was subscribed more than 400 times in India. That means demand for new shares was 400 times higher than that which was actually available. It was a sign of overheating, or inflation of the market, which isn’t sustainable. To seasoned market players, this might all look like your classic boom cycle. But India’s boom wasn’t driven primarily by seasoned pros.  With this boom market, there was also a rise in scams targeting fresh investors. There have been several high profile cases where people have been lured into the market, promised really high returns, and they ended up giving away their money to brokerages that never existed in the first place. It is not just people who are uneducated \nthat are falling into these scams. It is coming from cities, villages, and there are many people who have taken loans to invest. There was also a surge in influencers who encouraged risky trading,  often as all-or-nothing bets on future share prices. Last year, SEBI, India’s securities market regulator, published an eye-opening report that suggested 93% of such investors incurred losses. It also imposed rules to limit speculative trading.  And just look at the effect it had. Here’s the number of options contracts being traded over the last five years. Then SEBI’s report landed and options trading plunged. Volatility tests investors, and a world of strained alliances and economic uncertainty will challenge India’s investors keenly. On the one hand, we have impending tariffs that are likely \nto be levied by President Trump, and then on the other hand, we have China that continues to export, and many Indian businessmen are \nworried about dumping by China in the Indian economy. India’s economic growth is set to hit a four-year low this year. The rupee slid to record lows against the dollar, and is likely to remain under pressure. You’ve got earnings growth for the current financial year, which is kind of very muted, like low single digits. Until you see that recovery to justify the valuations, there isn’t a huge catalyst at the moment for India. While investors like Joseph hold onto India's growth narrative, regulators are finding it increasingly difficult to shield markets from rising economic uncertainty.", "duration(in seconds)": 599.0, "region": "US"}}

You all know that I am a partisan   observer of politics in the United States. But I \nmade made a pledge to you that I would tell you   just the facts when it comes to the economy. \nWhere are the numbers under Trump? And we are   going to continue doing exactly that. Let's just \nreview and see where we are and then see what we   can glean from it. Unemployment rate. at the end \nof president Biden's term was 4.1% under Donald   Trump. Now two months unemployment is at 4.0% \nit is flat. There has been no change as of this   moment to the unemployment rate under Donald. \nThe inflation rate when president Biden left,   it was at 2.9% year over year for the year ending \nDecember twenty twenty four. It briefly went up to   three and then is now down to 2.8 inflation under \nDonald Trump, essentially unchanged down slightly   from 2.9 to 2 point 8% GDP growth. It's going to \nbe a while until we get GDP data that encompasses   Donald Trump's presidency. We now got the Q four \nnumber from 2024. The economy grew and annualized   two point three percent the fourth quarter of \n2024. Totally normal, uncontroversial number.   Nothing crazy to look at and say, oh my God, \nthis is incredibly good. It's incredibly bad.   It is fine for a country and an economy the size \nof ours. Uh, really kind of like nothing to see   here. No Trump data yet. Uh, mortgage rates are \nslightly down. The 30 year fixed rate mortgage is   often the one that's used kind of as a barometer. \nWhen Joe Biden left, it was 7.04. It is now 6.67   after two months of Donald Trump down about \na quarter of a percentage point. Uh, this is,   you can argue it's good. I mean, the thing about \nmortgage rates is they tend to move opposite   a home prices. Thank you so much. When mortgage \nrates come down, all of a sudden people can afford   more house at the same payment and that can \ntend to have a slightly upward influence on   home prices. About a quarter point difference. So \nfar we talked about consumer sentiment as tracked   notably by the University of Michigan. And as you \ncan see here, certainly down slightly. We don't   yet have the February number. But that is where we \nare. And then stock market performance, notably,   uh, stocks up 22% in 2023 under Biden \nstocks up 22%. In 2024 under Joe Biden,   since Donald Trump has become president, the \nbroader markets on average are down 5.7%.   That is a significant stock market decline in a \nshort period of time under Donald Trump. So what,   what is the truth about economic data so far? \nbasically flat with two metrics about expectations   pointing down. Does this mean we're headed to a \nrecession? Not necessarily. Does this means that   this is inevitably the direction things are going \nto go? No, not necessarily. What we see is that   unemployment has not really changed. Inflation has \nnot changed. What we do see is consumer sentiment   down significantly suggesting the average American \nhas an expectation that things are not going to   be so good. in the near future. And the stock \nmarket, which is a futures market of sorts, it's   not literally trading futures. Literally trading \nfutures is something different. But in a sense,   the stockmarket is reacting to expectations \nabout what is coming. Tariffs, et cetera. And   the effect that that will have down 5.7% in just \na 50 something 6 62 something like that days. That   is not so good. those are the facts. Now we can \nstill interpret and make our analysis, but when   we talk about whatever metrics, we always want to \nstart with the data and go to the primary sources,   go to St. Louis fed, uh, go to The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics. And we do this no matter who   is president. Do not fall for the people who \nwill trust or not trust the exact same sources   depending on who is president. and depending on \nwhat direction a move is more convenient to them   politically. We can evaluate Trump's policies and \nthen we can also look at the data and then we put   it together. That's where we are right now. My \nquestion to you is whether there is any other   metric you want me to start including in our once \na month economic update. This is the second one of   Trump's presidency. We did one around February \n20th. We've now done one around March 20th,   plus a couple of days to get those final days \nof data. We will do one in another month. If   this needs to be expanded with additional metrics, \nlet me know info at David Pakman dot com. We will   take a quick break. My book comes out tomorrow.

coding, MacBook Pro", "script": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hello everyone welcome to another installment of my relaxing coding Vlog Series in this Vlog I'll be finishing up the changes that I started for my book and mostly I'll be focusing on the back end and fixing some of the security and other problematic areas that I created in my previous Vlog this is the last episode in the three-part series where I'm implementing the progress tracking feature that one of the users requested but if you're new here you don't have to watch the previous two Vlogs everything that I will talk about is going to be pretty clear and self-explanatory however if you're curious why I'm still carrying a pencil with me you should definitely watch the previous Vlog but if you know you know so this laptop that I have is a new M4 Pro MacBook Pro it's a 14 in with 24 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage and a lot of people ask me what my experience es with this machine so before I start with coding I will make an announcement that the next video will be about the MacBook and we will make a little bit of a break between the coding sessions I had it for a couple of months now and I feel like I have enough information to give you guys that goes a little bit beyond just the specs and the boring stuff that we all already know and I'll try my best to make a really nice informative video for you guys oh here's a fun little detail I had this hat made a while ago and I don't know if I ever showed it to you guys but it says business hat because at some point I was really into researching how business works and I even made like a secondary Channel that I never actually uploaded anything on that's called business hat so there's a little fun fact but anyhow a while ago I made a book about software engineering and long story short a lot of people actually checked it out and I had this one user request a feature where they wanted to track progress as they go through the book by being able to check certain pages as completed so this is basically what I'm working on and in the past two Vlogs I've done the UI I've done the basic API implementation for the end points to get and post progress as you're going through but I must say that I did a pretty naive job at implementing those set endpoints and so in this Vlog I'll primarily be focusing on improving them removing some of the security and other issues and I'll try to walk you through my thought process and why I'm doing certain things a certain way but again if you're new here the overarching philosophy of my code is that it's sort of under engineered and a lot of people like to call me out on that but it's fine I feel like this approach of just going in implementing only and exactly what you need has served me well for over 10 years now as I've been a developer professionally so let's do a bit of a code review what is good and what is bad about the code that I already have and so while it's good that I'm cherry-picking the exact property from the payload that I need in this case completed it is not good that I'm not checking what it is so the first Improvement obviously was to check the type of it and make sure that I'm not just blindly saving part of my payload to the database and this is the part of under engineering that I talked about a lot of people would suggest to use a data validation library but in my case because the scope of this endpoint is so small I don't expect to change its payload anytime soon and so it was more appealing to me as a developer to not install an external library and instead just rely on the features of the language that I have at my disposal another thing that is interesting to consider is that this is pretty much everything that this endpoint will ever do and so as such at at this point I don't feel particularly insecure about the fact that I'm doing everything in one function including the validation and saving things to the database but here is a question for you in an endpoint like this if you don't have an authenticated user should you return a401 a43 or a 404 it's very interesting I first noticed that GitHub actually returns 404 and I thought about why and then I realized it's simply to deter Bots from constantly hammering and discovering protected endpoints because if a bot receives a 404 it'll most likely give up but if it receives a 401 it will keep hammering it until something breaks and since then I've adopted a similar type of approach to my own endpoints but anyhow here's another fun fact maybe some of you don't realize that when recording these videos I typically blow up the phone size way up because in order for it to look natural on YouTube it has to be extremely big in real life so I played around with keyboard shortcuts to override a default Behavior which is to zoom in the entire interface and instead just zoom in and out my code and speaking of keyboard shortcuts another change that I made recently in one menu which is the window manager that I made that I'm also using here is to create a custom screen area that is like centered on the screen but not entirely full screen and then put it on the same exact key as the full screen area so that I can cycle between them and I really enjoyed using one of the features that I spent some time working on it was kind of a fun thing to do on the flip side what wasn't so much fun is when I got this notification that npm had a new major version and anytime this happens I get this sinking feeling in my stomach and I think what did you break now admit it but anyhow After ignoring it as any saying person would and restarting my server things started working and you can see here if you scroll to the bottom of every page there's a checkbox and when you click it it will save your completed status in the database and if you will excuse the P there is only one small thing to fix before I can call this feature completed and that is to Simply update the check mark in the navigation on the left to show when you click on the check box at the bottom of the page it was a simple task but I learned a new Quirk of JavaScript and I wanted to share it with you I mean maybe it's not a quirk of the language but it's still a quirk maybe some of you know that when you're working with an HTML anchor element which is essentially a link it will expose an hre property but its value is not the same as the value of the hre attribute because the property seemingly Returns the full URL of the page that you're linking to whereas the H attribute Returns what you actually have set in HTML I thought that was an interesting Quirk and this is exactly why I'm making these Vlogs because almost every time that I sit down to code something one of these little things come up and I just want to share them with you but anyhow I just spent the rest of my time Vibe coding I guess or in other words reviewing the code that is supposed to be committed without any tests and then I went ahead to deploy it on Railway which is the hosting platform that I'm using and it's not sponsored by them in any way but I just find them convenient and I like this feature where they visualize the architecture you have and the connections between your services if you happen to be referencing them from one another I just thought that was kind of cool and so that's pretty much it I think we can call this feature completed and yeah by the time you're watching this it's already in production and as an aside there is a lot of free pages in that book so I'm really hopeful that some of you will check it out maybe even just for fun and in the meantime I decided to take a quick scroll because we finally have some nicer weather in Norway and if you enjoy the video a like and a sub would be very much appreciated and I'll see you in the next one you [Music] [Music] he", "duration(in seconds)": 451.0, "region": "US"}}

April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!”\nTrump’s post Wednesday evening comes as his administration prepares to unveil a fresh wave of tariffs, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled was hanging over forecasts. \nFed officials held their benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday for a second straight meeting, as expected by economists. Powell downplayed simmering concerns about a slowdown but acknowledged tariff uncertainty was a factor and already contributing to goods inflation, but may prove transitory.\n\nTrump’s administration is preparing to announce a fresh wave of tariffs on April 2, though the exact scope isn’t clear. Trump has promised so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on at least some nations, though his administration has not specified which ones or at what rate, and his key economic advisers have competing views on the best way to approach tariff policy. \nThe public push back on interest rates comes as the Trump White House tries to make its case for stiffer tariffs amid a mixed economic picture in the US. Inflation has not abated as much as American consumers would like. High interest rates are squeezing the housing market, and economists now see economic growth slowing in the upcoming months. \nTrump has sent repeated mixed messages on the Fed — at times calling for cuts and otherwise declining to intervene. Similarly, during the campaign, he vacillated on how independent he said the Fed should be from the White House.\n\r\n--------\r\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\r\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\r\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\r\n \r\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\r\n\r\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\r\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\r\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\r\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\r\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\r\n\r\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\r\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\r\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\r\n \r\nVisit our YouTube channels:\r\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\r\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\r\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\r\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake", "tags": "Carol Massar, Donald Trump, Federal Reserve, Howard Lutnick, Market Volatility, Peter Atwater, Scott Bessent, Tim Stenovec, Trump administration, Trump economic policy, US economy, US stocks, Volatility, tariffs", "script": "Yeah, we never really know where to go.\nBut what's so interesting to me about where we are today is that there has\nbeen this huge mind shift from Inauguration Day to today.\nSo, you know, coming into inauguration, people were fantasizing wildly about\nwhere the markets were going, where the new administration was going to take the\neconomy in the markets. And since then, investors have had to\ncome to grips with the fact that there is, without question, a shift in\nbehavior out of Washington where President Trump is behind the wheel.\nAnd so investors are used to being in the passenger's seat with specific\ncompanies, with, you know, next to CEOs for good and for ill.\nBut now they're having to look at their entire portfolio and decide, are the\ninvestments I'm involved in going to be beneficiaries of the new administration\nor victims of the. It's just so interesting to hear this,\nbecause I think there's this narrative that emerged following the first Trump\nadministration that this is a guy who looks to the Dow and the S&P 500 as a\nscorecard, as a sort of report card. And indeed, during his first\nadministration, he touted numbers there. Yet we heard a different narrative\nemerge this time, Peter. Do you buy it that he's not paying\nattention to the stock market? One of the things we know about\nPresident Trump is he loves to cite metrics that work in his favor.\nSo I'm not surprised with the markets dropping that he's looking for\nalternative measures of of consumer satisfaction in the economy.\nBut I think at the end of the day, what he is trying to demonstrate more than\nanything else is that he and he alone is going to dictate economic policy,\nAmerican diplomatic policy, and everyone else needs to come to grips with that.\nBut is there a point like. Yeah, no, it's interesting, Peter,\nbecause how many conversations I've had with folks and they're like, Oh, you\nknow how this is going to play out. It's just like, you know, you reported\non it the first go round and it feels so different.\nAnd I think so many people are realizing this is different this time around.\nHaving said that, is there a point, a breaking point where the team around the\npresident somehow has a bigger say like they did in the first administration?\nBecause right now it does feel like. Absolutely.\nLike you lay it out, the president's in the driver's seat and everyone is there\nin the back seat to back them up. Yeah, One of the things that I say to my\nstudents is falling confidence. Individuals grow spines.\nAnd so what we're likely to see is that should the markets continue to drop,\nshould consumer confidence continue to fall, those around him will feel\ncompelled to react. Whether that's sufficient or not, we\ndon't know. And to be fair, Carol, there are a\nnumber of organizations and individuals who feel wildly empowered now.\nMm hmm. And so we're we're in this interesting\nmoment where individuals and organizations are having to decide in\nwhich camp do they expect to fall. Because one of the things we've see with\nwith dominant leaders such as Trump is there are clear benefits and there are\nalso clear punishment. Well, how do you advise people to\nweather this storm if you indeed think it is a storm?\nBecause there are a lot of people we talked to, Peter, say, okay, wait a\nsecond. Once he gets tax cuts, figure it out.\nOnce we get to April and there's more clarity when it comes to trade.\nThings will become less volatile. What do you say to that?\nSo I think that the investors have to be thinking.\nI say a lot. You know.\nPlan for what you can imagine, but be prepared for what you can't.\nIn this environment, investors and corporate executives need to have two\nplaybooks at once. One is in anticipation of things going\nin their favor, but also a very clear playbook for if this goes against me.\nWhat do I do? What is my what are my preparations\nplanned ahead in anticipation of that? Because is the outcome here is going to\nbe very binary. And that's what we see over and over, is\nthat when you create beneficiaries and victims, the vulnerability that comes\nfrom the victims sets things in motion. We're seeing that in Europe right now,\nwhere I'm going, where the geopolitical vulnerability has leaders on edge and\nthey're mobilizing in response. I'm going to ask you something crazy,\nPeter, is is one of the outcomes here on an investor perspective that the US\nbecomes un investable, in your view? I think that is a clear possibility.\nI think that investors have to be made comfortable that the United States is\ninterested in foreign capital, in retaining domestic capital.\nAnd appreciate, Jim, that if you look at labor goods and capital we are seeing,\nwe've already seen restrictions in walls go up on the immigration front.\nWe're seeing tariffs creating friction in terms of the mobility of goods.\nIt is to me only a question of time when capital falls into that same playing\nfield where public policy begins to intervene, and not just in the United\nStates, but but globally in terms of wanting it, not wanting it, hoarding it,\npushing it away. Those those are completely in sync with\nwhat we're seeing with labor and and goods.", "duration(in seconds)": 402.0, "region": "US"}}

[Squeaks squeaks] Oh! Hey everyone, Squeaks and I are learning about\nthe planet Mars. [Squeaks squeaks] Yes, it does have a lot of cool features,\nlike the biggest volcano in the Solar System. And blue sunsets! I’d love to go see them. [Squeaks squeaks] Whoa! Slow down, Squeaks. It sure would be exciting to send people to\nMars, but it’s not as simple as hopping aboard\na rocket ship. Scientists and engineers have to plan everything\nout very, very carefully! For instance, you can’t launch your spaceship\nwhenever you want. [Squeaks squeaks] I know. See, Mars and Earth are both orbiting, or\ncircling around, the Sun. But Mars orbits farther away from our Sun\nthan Earth does, and it moves more slowly. This means they aren’t always the same distance\nfrom each other. Sometimes they’re super close to one another, and sometimes they’re on opposite sides\nof the Sun! So you have to wait for the right time when\nthe two planets are in the perfect spots so that a rocket can leave Earth, travel through\nspace, and reach Mars…all while everything is still\nmoving! [Squeaks squeaks] Yeah, you’re right. It is complicated. But scientists can do the math to figure out\nexactly when it’s okay to launch a rocket to Mars. These special times are called launch windows. And because Earth and Mars keep changing where\nthey are, these launch windows only happen every 26\nmonths or so! That’s a little over two years. [Squeaks squeaks] Oh! If a rocket misses its launch window, the\nteam launching the rocket usually has to wait until the next one, and\nthat can take a long time! [Squeaks squeaks] Oh! That’s a great question, Squeaks. You could launch at another time. But it would take a lot more fuel. That would make the rocket heavier, and harder\nto launch. And getting to Mars takes a long time, too! A trip to Mars would probably take about seven\nto nine months! It’s a long time, but the space between\nplanets is really big. [Squeaks squeaks] Yeah, I would want to go outside the spaceship\nand stretch at some point, too. But, it’s not safe to do that. Once you’re in space, it’s a dangerous\ntrip! Just like sailors on Earth have to deal with\nstorms, astronauts traveling to Mars have to watch\nout for space weather. [Squeaks squeaks] Yeah! Space has weather too! But it isn’t the same as our weather on\nEarth. Most space weather in our Solar System comes\nfrom our Sun. Every day, it spits out lots of teeny tiny\nparticles that astronomers call the solar wind. And sometimes the Sun does its own kind of\nburp, sending a giant burst of these particles out\ninto space all at once. That can create a kind of solar storm. So, it can be dangerous for an astronaut to\nbe hit by space weather because it can make them sick. [Squeaks squeaks] Don’t worry, Squeaks! Buddy! We’re safe from space weather down here\non Earth, because our planet can protect us. [Squeaks squeaks] But ships that go into space, need to be\nbuilt with special materials that can protect the astronauts inside. Can you think of anything that humans use to protect themselves from tiny particles? [Squeaks squeaks] Yes! That’s really smart, Squeaks, you have to\nwear a lead apron when you get an X-ray at the dentist. Lead is really good at blocking harmful particles, like particles from the Sun’s solar wind,\nbut it’s also really heavy. When you’re making a spaceship, you want to use materials that are as light\nas possible. Rockets can’t be heavy or they would need\neven more fuel to get off the ground. So we can’t just wrap our spaceship in a\nbig lead apron. The ship could have a small protected room\ninside that astronauts could stay in whenever the space weather got really bad. But they would need scientists back on Earth\nto predict when a big storm is coming, and warn them ahead of time. [Squeaks squeaks] Yeah! And after all that, there’s still one more\nchallenge to face: landing the ship! Scientists and engineers have experimented\nwith lots of different ways to land. When a ship arrives at Mars’ atmosphere,\nor air, it'll be going very fast. It’ll be going so fast, the air can’t\nmove out of the way. The air gets smushed and it gets really, really\nhot…hot enough to melt metal! So to protect the landing spaceship, it needs to have a special layer called a\nheat shield. Falling through the air this way will slow\nit down a lot. But after the heat shield finishes its job, the ship needs to find another way to slow\ndown. Luckily, we’ve safely landed a bunch of\nrobots on Mars in the past and learned a lot from those missions. [Squeaks squeaks] So, engineers have used lots of ways to land\ntheir robots over the years. My favorite was giant, bouncy airbags! [Squeaks squeaks] You’re right, that might be a little too\nrough for human beings! So maybe we could use a combination of some\nother, more gentle methods, like starting with a really big parachute\nand ending with small rockets that let part of the craft hover while a sky\ncrane lowers the spacecraft to the ground. [Squeaks squeaks] Yep! Then we’ll be on the ground, and we can\nstart exploring! [Squeaks squeaks] Yeah, getting to Mars won’t be easy! But we can learn so much from trying. Engineers and scientists are hard at work\nevery day to find out the best way to get humans safely\nto Mars. There are a lot of challenges they’ll have\nto solve, but it’ll all be worth it when the first\nastronauts get to hop around on another planet! Thanks to our partner, the Museum of Science, for collaborating with us on this episode\nof SciShow Kids.

MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ABOVE. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT BELOW. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE AROUND 5% AS XI JINPING CLAIMS. CHERYL:  THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS FASCINATING. JOHN LONSKI, GET IN THERE. >>  YEAH, GORDON. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS GOING NOWHERE AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN CLOSELY ALLIED WITH COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA AND IRAN AS OPPOSED TO SEEKING WARMER, FRIENDLIER RELATIONS WITH THEIR MAJOR CUSTOMERS LIKE THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE. I JUST DON'T GET THE CHINESE ECONOMY A CHANCE. MY VIEW IS THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY MADE A HORRIBLE DECISION AS FAR AS WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA AND A LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN LIVING STANDARDS. >>  WELL, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BECAUSE CHINA'S ECONOMY RIGHT NOW DEPENDS ON EXPORTS. AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AND EVEN COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH ARE NOW STARTING TO TARIFF AND OTHERWISE RESTRICT CHINESE PURCHASES OF CHINESE PRODUCTS. THAT IS A DEATH SENTENCE FOR THE CHINESE ECONOMY. AND THEY NEED TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH BRUSSELS, WITH WASHINGTON, WITH ALL SORTS OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND UNFORTUNATELY XI JINPING HAS ALLIED HIMSELF WITH RUSSIA, WITH IRAN, NORTH KOREA, AND THOSE ARE COUNTRIES THAT BY AND LARGE CAN'T HELP THE CHINESE ECONOMY. WE CAN. BUT WE WON'T BECAUSE WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT CHINA IS AN ADVERSARY AND IN 3450EU VIEW MYE ACTUALLY AN ENEMY. THE POINT IS, WE ARE NOW SEEING CHINA IN A VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT THAN WE DID FIVE OR 10 YEARS AGO. CHERYL:  THAT'S WHY THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PANAMA CANAL IS SO PREVALENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE CHINESE. >>  YES, ABSOLUTELY, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WE HAD PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPLICATIONS IN DETERRING THE CCP AND RIGHT NOW IN THE PANAMA CANAL WE KNOW THE CHINESE COMPANIES OPERATE THE PORTS ON BOTH ENDS OF CANAL SO WE HAVE TO USE OUR ECONOMIC FORCE TO MAKE SURE THE CANAL WORKS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE DEAL WASN'T FOR CHINA TO RUN THE CANAL. THE DEAL WAS FOR PANAMA TO CONTROL AND RUN IT. THAT WASN'T PART OF THE DEAL. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STANDING UP TO THE CCP. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. HE WILL DO IT AGAIN FOR US. CHERYL:  THERE'S A LOT TO WATCH UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND AGENDA. GORDON CHANG, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE", "duration(in seconds)": 421.0, "region": "US"}}

obsolete plus coding is easy so you really have no excuse these are all statements that are not true but i've been told that fear-based sales tactics will scare you into subscribing to my youtube channel in today's video i'm going to share a variety of practical techniques that have helped me learn to code because learning in and of itself is a skill and if you want to be a software engineer you'll need to learn new things all the time many moons ago i didn't know how to code i wanted to learn because i hated my low paying miserable job and wanted to build some kind of app on the internet that would allow me to break out and start my own business i figured i wasn't smart enough to code but you only live once so i bought a giant book about php and mysql and sure enough i wasn't smart enough to code and those toilets weren't going to clean themselves i went back to my crappy job and forgot about it luckily a little while later my family needed a website so i figured i was at least smart enough to learn html and somehow a few months later i figured out how to ship my first website the important thing to recognize when learning to code is that hard work is more valuable than talent talon is great if you have it and there are 10x developers out there where things just click on a much higher level but programming is a skill very similar to playing a musical instrument or juggling for most people you totally suck at first then you feel like a genius when you code your first program then you realize you totally suck again and this pattern goes on and on forever in an infinite loop learning is supposed to be painful in fact i believe that you need pain to grow when learning a guitar you need to put your fingertips through a lot of pain before you build calluses in programming you'll have to bang your head against the keyboard a bunch of times until you figure out how to make these error messages go away so if you don't have talent be prepared to embrace the hard work now as you learn you might be wondering which programming language should i start with the truth is that it doesn't matter as long as you get really good at one of them the thing about programming is that there's so much to learn you are never going to retain at all i used to be a really good ruby programmer but at this point i've forgotten almost everything about it and that's no big deal because memorizing syntax doesn't really matter the thing you really want to learn and retain are programming patterns essentially everything you do in programming is problem solving the idea is to create a repertoire of tools in your brain that you can then use to solve virtually any problem in any language for example if you need to loop over something but you've never used pearl before you still understand the trade-offs between a for loop while loop and recursion this is the exact reason that when you go to a technical interview they usually don't care which language you use they just want to see that you know how to solve problems and in some cases they may only have you write pseudocode on a whiteboard to analyze your problem-solving skills so in learning i would recommend trying out a few different languages and learn the one that feels most natural to you for most people i think python is ideal because it has a minimal syntax is extremely popular and is also just a very useful language to know in general but javascript go kotlin and swift are also good languages to start with but again it's about becoming a problem solver not about memorizing syntax and that begs the question how do i become a good problem solver the answer is go solve a bunch of problems turn off youtube and go write some code will you ever learn to play guitar by watching other people on youtube play guitar the answer is no you also need to be playing the guitar along with them books and tutorials are great sign up for fireship pro but they're utterly useless if you're not coding along with them in my tutorials i try to set you up with something cool to build so you can go have fun and fail on your own you can build things based on tutorials you can try to build your own stuff you can do coding challenges participate in hackathons and all kinds of other stuff if you're serious you should be coding at least a couple hours every day there's a reason they require pilots to have a certain number of flying hours experience matters more than anything else and luckily for you to get time in the saddle all you have to do is sit on your ass in front of your computer screen and hit the keyboard until something cool happens speaking of which sitting on your ass in front of a computer screen is not natural or healthy and that means you need to work extra hard in this line of work to protect your health both mentally and physically that's why i prefer to eat at arby's the most trusted name and nutrition i also get plenty of sunshine and exercise to offset the time i spend banging my head against the keyboard in my mom's dark windowless basement if your health is not optimal you won't learn as efficiently and there's no activity in the world that's worth sacrificing your health over now let's switch gears and talk about a physicist named richard feynman he's a nobel prize winner known for many things one of which is his learning technique it goes like this choose a concept you want to learn about explain it to a 12 year old reflect refine simplify then organize and review in other words you learn most efficiently when you try to teach the very thing you're learning i can tell you right now that i've learned way more about programming from running this youtube channel than i ever did working all by myself now that doesn't mean that everybody needs to go and start a youtube channel all you have to do is pretend to teach something but if you can create valuable content out of it like a video or blog post that's even better or if you already have a job you'll find that you learn a lot just by mentoring other people or if you don't have a job you can join programming slack or discord channels and help people out there or answer questions on stack overflow helping others feels good and it forces you to be extremely precise about what you actually know here's how it might look for a programmer choose a topic like i want to program a video game do some research and experimenting and write a summary explaining the technology to a 12 year old then go and build something and get to a full working demo as quickly as possible it doesn't need to be perfect because in the final step you'll go back and refactor and simplify and find ways to improve your process and get feedback from someone more experienced than you if possible so approach it like a teacher even though you have no idea what you're currently teaching now i said something very subtle but very important and that is to build a full working demo as quickly as possible learning is supposed to be painful but there also needs to be some kind of reward for that pain and the more quickly you can get to those rewards the better because what you want is a positive feedback loop that basically makes you addicted to coding there are ways we can hack the most primitive parts of our brain what i do almost every day before i go to bed is write down a few small goals that i want to achieve the next day the important thing is that the goals are achievable because then writing a check mark next to that goal feels good when good things happen your brain releases dopamine and you want to try to find activities that after hard work give you that dopamine hit because otherwise you'll have a negative feedback loop in which case you're going to absolutely hate coding in no time that'd be like learning how to press the strings on a guitar without ever knowing how to play an actual song the idea is to work hard and be rewarded but you don't want to work too hard it's extremely important especially for programming to pace yourself and take regular breaks for most people that likely means one or two hours of programming followed by a nice long break i remember in my early days being absolutely determined to not let the error messages win i'd go late into the night stack overflowing every possible combination of questions only to give up and get a good night's sleep and then come back and immediately solve the problem in the morning and this isn't unique to me it happens to everybody because mental spacing is actually a very important thing you can be mentally exhausted while at the same time your ego is saying you got this bro don't be a loser but the reality is that the most efficient thing to do is go outside get some sunshine jump in a cold body of water and get some sleep when you wake up you'll be ready to crush it once again now that you know how to learn to code all you have to do is go to google type in what you want to learn and let it be your guide because that's basically all you ever do as a software engineer i'm going to go ahead and wrap things up there make sure to hit the subscribe button to get the next video in

And   she he acknowledged, yes, yes. But it's only \ngoing to be short term. Let's take a listen.  that maybe there's short-term pain, but long-term \ngain here. But you just mentioned some of those   countries. I mean, I was looking at the numbers. \n95% of Montana's imported goods come from Canada,   Mexico, and China. Is this going to \nhurt people in your state, you think?  there's absolutely going to be short-term pain. \nThe president's been clear about that. Everyone   has. I mean, if you're going to remodel \nyour house to make it better in the end,   it's going to really annoying in the short-terms \nwhen your house is getting remodeled. And there's   drywall desks everywhere and there's workers in \nyour living room. The reality is that remodel has   got to happen in order to make things stronger and \nmore stable on the back end. We've had generations   now of countries taking advantage of the strong \nAmerican economy, the strong America workforce.  You know, um, Montana, she, he's state, uh, \nMontana's a state that relies significantly on   exports and agriculture. Exports and agriculture \nare going to be brutalized if Trump's tariffs come   to fruition tomorrow. Montana's economy is deeply \ntied to wheat and beef and barley exports to other   countries. When Trump starts a trade war with \ntariffs and the other countries hit back It's   very bad for the state of Montana. In fact, \nthe last time Trump slapped tariffs on China,   uh, during his first term, uh farmers in the U S \nlost billions and the government ended up having   to fork over tens of billions in bailouts. And it \nlooks like they're going to have to do it again.   And most of it was over, um, the agriculture \nsector. Uh, there is one other clip I want to   play for you here. Um, uh, as to the question \nof, are you going to have to bail out the farm?  But on tariffs themselves, do you \nexpect that you as a member of   Congress will have to vote to bail farmers out?\nWe're going to be there for them if we have to be.  and you would go bigger than \n28 billion if you need to.  I mean, we don't have a metric on it yet. I mean \nthe landscape is just different than what it was   last time, but we have to protect our egg sector. \nI mean we have be able to feed our country.  So listen, Montana's wheat exports to Asia, \nthey've already been hurt by previous trade wars.   Tariffs simply raise the cost of everything. They \nalso raise the costs for equipment. So not only is   there a trade war with regard to the finished \nproduct, you also have the issue of tractors,   irrigation systems, storage bins, fertilizer. All \nof this stuff relies on imported materials and   it's all going to cost more. So not only will they \nmake less money from their exports. They're going   to be spending more to operate. This is really \nnot short term pain for long term gain. It's   just pain. Now, contrast this with an example of \neconomic pain that does lead to benefit. So I'll   give you an example. Transitioning to clean \nenergy, renewable clean energy. Yes. Building   solar farms, building out the wind infrastructure. \nThere are upfront costs. There will be people in   the fossil fuel world who in the short term would \nbe hurt by a complete and total transition to   clean renewable energy over time, it will lower \nenergy costs. It will create local jobs. It will,   create industries and it will make the country \nmore secure by reducing our dependence on foreign   oil. That's a legit example of short-term pain for \nlong-term economic gain. Tariffs are just pain.   This isn't going to work for anybody. Another \nexample, infrastructure spending. when you do   infrastructure spending. It's expensive. It's \nslow. People say the bridge is down. I've got to   take an inconvenient route to work. The highway is \nunder repair. There's traffic, this sort of thing,   but you get better roads. You get better internet. \nYou get a better transit and you do create jobs   that then pay dividends for decades. Those are \nexamples of short term pain for long term gain.   Trump's tariffs, just flat blanket tariffs. They \nmake everything more expensive. Groceries cost   more tools will cost more clothing. It doesn't \nfix. anything. It's just pain. And Tim Sheehy,   as a Senator for Montana, is going to have to go \nback and explain to his constituents why this is   actually good for them. Even when it isn't, he'll \ncome up with something, but it doesn't seem like   anybody's buying it. Trump's economic approval \nin the toilet. We'll talk about that. Probably   won't get to it today, but later this week This \nis not just a book about how American politics   got so broken. It's also about what's happening \nright now and what we can still do to stop things   from getting worse. Trump's been back in power. \nThe results have been even more catastrophic   than many feared with targeting of political \nopponents and gutting democratic institutions,   laying the groundwork to even further consolidate \npower. But the thing is that none of this is   inevitable. The same forces that brought us \nhere can be countered. If we understand how   they work and what to do about them. And that's \nwhat the echo machine is all about. Some say   that without corporate media backing books like \nthis can't succeed. I think we can prove them   wrong. You can get the echo Machine right now \nat David Pakman dot com slash echo on Amazon,   Barnes and Noble, Audible, Kindle, or by \ncalling any local bookstore and asking them   to order it. This book is more important \nthan ever.

up a first round TKO then he picked up another first round TKO two months later last year he signed with ryzen made his debut in September in the openweight Grand Prix against ra isidoro winning via

time in Japan but he watched all of the pride events back in the day and he never thought he'd be here a dream come true [Music] five and one three of those victories coming inside the distance for Amir aliakbari the superlative wrestler 10 minutes five minutes two round match no head batting no airbow striking elbowed to the Head are not permitted in This heavyweight attraction and unlike the first heavyweight fight of the night let's hope that these two heavyweights go at it like Wendy's and Hardies onal media the beef is in the rising ring what do you look for early Frank well I mean to me it's whoever lands the first strike I think aliakbar is probably a better Striker looks a little more balanced and centered or better Striker when it comes to this game I think uh it's going to be a grappling match body shots in the clinch KN to the body by Los Santos and this is uh the position aliakbar wants to be a Greco Roman wrestler the go behind Wast lock by aliakbari and of course we

he's being crucified right now well that's dos Santos in the crucifix position ground and pound by alak body and this is bad position for dos Santos early in the fight I didn't tell he's got no answer for it hard part about this position is you start really putting energies into it you start really getting nervous because you can't move your arm you can't move your your position at all you start making silly escapes and wasting a lot of energy you have a cool story about one of Dos Santos or excuse me aliak bari's coaches Mike swick former military member contacted you back in the day back in

excuse me being peppered by Amir aliakbari who has him in this crucifix position now look at this choke yeah sliding this in forearm choke say what's funny is I bet you he wishes he had elbows now

Please subscribe to stay tuned. 😊", "tags": "gymnastics, tumbling, flips, how to do gymnastics", "script": "hey friends it's Rylie if you're trying to learn your toe touch or just improve your jumps this video is for you first we need to understand exactly what we want to accomplish in a toe touch a lot of people confuse this with the straddle jump but these two jumps are in fact very different so let's set the record straight a straddle jump makes a perfectly straight line with your legs in the air which is done by opening your hips as far as possible in a middle split a toe touch on the other hand is less about flexibility and more about using your hip flexors to pull your legs up to hit a V shape the key is to think about showing the middle seam of your shorts to the front now that that's clarified let's move on to the prep before your jump which is crucial for setting you up for a good toe touch the first step is to stand tall and tight actively squeezing all of your muscles next clap your hands together in front of you there are different variations of this but for simplicity I'm just keeping tight straight arms third draw arms up and raise to your tippy toes notice how from the side my arms are covering my eyeballs and my shoulders are slightly rounded from there swing your arms back down and bend your knees in a slight squat think of this move as if your body is a spring it needs to be compressed down before it can spring back up this acts as a loading position so you can then explode upward in your jump by pushing through your legs don't forget to also push up your toes which will help you gain more height practice this explosion with a t jump one last thing to note when I throw my arms down I'm doing this with force and immediately bringing them to a sharp t which also contributes to the power in my jump now let's move on to drills when I first transition from gymnastics to cheer this drill was so helpful in teaching me how to scoop my hips under first find a mat that's slightly taller than your hip level stand slightly in front and warm up a t jump making sure you have enough height to sit up on the mat this time do the same thing but with a toe touch the goal is to tuck your butt under think the opposite of sticking out your butt round your lower back and think about pulling the bottom of your pelvis to the sky also kick up your toes as high as possible next drill is a frog jump aka pineapple jump the point is to help you learn how to get your hips and thighs to the right position without worrying about extending your legs when you do this make sure you're tucking your butt and focusing on pulling your hamstrings in as close to your sides as possible something fun and effective to try is bouncing on a trampoline and using the extra air time to practice whacking your legs as high as you can in your toe touch let's move forward to exercises starting with strengthening your hip flexors sit on the ground and open your legs to a straddle place your hands flat on the floor and in between your legs using your hip flexors as swift as you can pull your legs up to hit a V shape then slowly lower back down this exercise can be made even more effective by using ankle weights but beware it's more difficult and the burn is a lot worse for even more exercises try leg circles going back and also small leg pulses without touching the ground in order to land our toe touches with our legs together let's strengthen our legs lay on your back with your arms in a t pull your legs up as if you were in a toe touch position then quickly slam them together at the ground you can add ankle weights to this exercise as well next grab two sliders and stand one foot on each stand with your legs spread wide and quickly slide your feet together the wider your stance the more difficult but effective this exercise will be next to increase height and power in your jump try box jumps back mats as high as you can while still being able to safely jump up to your feet if you can try to also land in a frog position as we established earlier this is a good shape to train for toe touches if you struggle with leaning your chest over in your jumps this next part is for you find a ledge preferably a stable one and sit on the very edge with your feet in front of you avoid leaning your chest forward and instead focus on squeezing and staying upright as you kick your legs up to a toe touch position also try these heel to butt squat jumps keep your upper body tall and tight the whole time and hit a t shape in the air these are honestly harder than they look this exercise is so good because it targets your calves thighs and helps drill an upright chest for good strong t arms you need to be actively flexing your arm and shoulder muscles good exercises to build strength for this are arm circles and arm bounces so yeah and obviously if you wanna get even stronger add some light 1 to 5 pound weights for these exercises finally let's talk about t kicks these are a great exercise especially for warming up jumps during these kicks focus on fundamentals keep a tall chest tight arms straight legs and powerful kicks coming back down to touch the other leg going forward when throwing your toe touches remember these things keep a tight body in the prep throw your arms down with force push off your toes tuck your butt under and use your hip flexors to pull your toes up as fast and powerful as you can your chest upright and hit your arms in a tight t then squeeze your body back together obviously that's a lot to think about in one jump which is why we have so many drills and exercises to establish these good habits in our muscle memory keep working hard I hope this was helpful and thanks for watching",

war is another country's opportunity That's how India should see this Yes there will be a hit but there will also be opportunities New Delhi's job is to hunt for those chances and one area could be rare earth metals Like I said China has halted the export of these metals to the US It's a move that could US businesses But could India intervene can we plug the gap left by China let's try to answer that tonight First of all what are rare earth metals these are a group of 17 elements in the periodic table Most of them have really weird names like europium or holmium or scandium As weird as they sound they're pretty important You need rare earths to make a number of crucial products like semiconductors electric vehicle motors fighter jets and missiles wind turbines and even your LED lights Basically these are metals of the future And where does China come in well China dominates rare earth production China makes up 70% 70% of all rare earth output They also make up 90% of rare earth magnets These are magnets made from rare earth metals They're key to making EVs Now this dominance is not an accident China identified the importance of rare earths back in the 1990s First they put tight controls on the deposits Rare earths were declared as strategic and protected reserves Then China invested in processing technology Like all ores rare earth has to be extracted and processed And China took the lead in doing that And since then there's been no looking back This near monopoly is worrying for other countries China's latest ban has spooked the White House Listen to what Trump's trade advisor said The rare earth limits are being studied very carefully and they're concerning and we're thinking about all the options right now The US is rightly worried because rare earths go into almost everything even their flagship F-35 fighter jets Normally such crucial inputs would be stocked But reports say most American companies do not have stocks because rare earths are quite costly If you stock them a lot of your cash would be tied up I'm sure they're regretting that decision now But what's the way forward could India play a role here on paper yes Look at the largest reserves of rare earths in our world China is at number one they have around 44 million tons of it Second is Brazil with 21 million tons and India is actually third with 6.9 million tons Australia is fourth with 5.7 million and Russia is at the fifth position So availability is not a problem In fact it never was Don't fall for the name rare earths Most of these metals are not actually rare They're found across the earth Then what is the problem extraction and processing India and the US are hoping to collaborate on this It came up during Prime Minister Modi's recent trip to the White House Both sides agreed to join to jointly explore opportunities The problem is this is going to take time Rare earth's industry cannot be built overnight China's rare earth industry was not built overnight either It has it was created over decades Nonetheless it's important to prepare for the long term to create an alternative rare earth supply chain and Donald Trump is certainly game He is hunting for rare earths in wartorn Ukraine and freezing Greenland So he's clearly desperate for alternatives and India Well last month the government announced a major move It allowed private companies to mine rare earths So clearly India is aware of the opportunity The question is how quickly can we scale it because time is of the essence and I'm not just talking about rare earths I'm also talking about the broader manufacturing pivot India wants to become an alternative to Chinese factories Most policy makers feel that the time is ripe They point to Trump Trump's hefty tariffs on other Asian producers Remember India was tariffed at 26% but other Asian countries faced a much higher tariff So on paper this will help India This should it will make Indian goods more competitive but that alone will not sway companies Producers will look for other factors as well like how cheap are the raw materials how good is the public infrastructure how easy is it to acquire land and set up a business how soon can you settle disputes All these factors affect the final decision of a business perhaps more than tariffs So India's focus should be on creating a robust manufacturing environment Public infrastructure has grown leaps and bounds in the last 10 years The ease of doing business has also improved But clearly more needs to be done If not India could miss the manufacturing bus again Greeting you with aloha and namaste I I love India Presence uh occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India what we saw in Kashmir and the prime minister How do you see Trump's America yes the current administration behaves differently from the previous administration who are trying to bring down the current government in Syria Exactly Iran maybe Russia alternative to Prime Minister Modi committed to South you know cooperations for not over 50% Is Ukraine prepared to pay the price for that peace no compromises at the cost of territorial integrity and sovereignity very much You're Sorry", "duration(in seconds)": 450.0, "region": "US"}}

saving and paying down debt and budgeting but the overwhelming majority of votes went to investing and I know investing can feel super overwhelming because it's so jargon heavy but today I'm gonna break down investing into the simplest of terms using an easy analogy and I'll also explain what to look out for to make sure you have the best portfolio and if all that isn't simple enough I'll even give you an easy hack to Fast Track Your investing Journey let's get to it first things first let me address the big question I always get what exactly do I invest in and the BFFs always think I'm gonna have magically just a list of the 10 best stocks for them to blindly buy just because I said so I hate to break it to you but nobody knows what the perfect investment is everybody wants to find the perfect investment you hedge fund managers and billionaire there's a like are all looking for the best thing and even though hedge funds and billionaires have endless resources unlike us they still can't seem to get it right while I was a Trader on Wall Street I saw hedge funds blow up all the time because people made bad investment decisions so please know there's no such thing as the perfect investment and in fact we need to rewind before you worry about what investments you're gonna buy we need to figure out what's going to hold your Investments so step one you are going to pick an account these aren't Investments themselves they are just online tote bags they hold stuff you can get a special tote bag like a 401k or a 403b or an IRA or a Roth IRA specific for retirement or you could get a tote bag specific for saving for your kiddos education called a 529 or you could get a blank tote bag that you can access at any time called an individual brokerage account for General investing you can research the account types that might make the most sense for you depending on your goals when do you want to have access to that money what are you investing for and you're going to open up one of these at any financial institution this can be with your bank a new fintech with a sleeker online interface if you're more digital first like Sofi which is what I opt for or at one of the old traditional brokerages like a Fidelity Vanguard Schwab or E-Trade then we move on to step two now you're going to fund the account this is literally so simple all you're doing is taking cash out of your checking or savings account at your bank or credit union and putting it into your investment account this is done digitally and most platforms just have you either link your bank account or connect it through plaid simple enough and last step three the fun part we pick Investments and instead of telling you my top 10 Stock picks I'm going to tell you how I buy hundreds of companies at the same time without having to spend a fortune you're going to buy ETFs and mutual funds in particular I like index funds don't let these names or phrases confuse you for the purpose of your investing what you really need to know is that they are essentially just baskets of Investments instead of just buying one company you can access hundreds or thousands at a time one thing I do want you to be on the lookout for When selecting These funds you'd like to invest in is the expense ratio while trading platforms are no longer charging commissions for transactions mutual funds ETFs and other baskets of Investments still do charge a fee I mean someone has to do all the work of putting them together or at least they have to fund the technology that does right and that costs money and these fees are called expense ratios it's a percentage that you'll pay on top of your gains or losses for example say an investment has a 0.1 expense ratio if you make eight percent you'd actually make seven point nine percent if you lost five percent you'd actually have lost five point one percent expense ratios are important because sometimes similar Investments have different expense ratios for example if you wanted an S P 500 tracking ETF you could buy spy but the expense ratio is much higher than vo which essentially does the same thing by choosing vo instead you'd save money annually while accomplishing the same Financial goal and speaking of good funds that offer Diversified Investments here are a few great options but as always this is not Financial advice I don't know your personal situation and please do your own research you can also choose to invest in a Target date retirement fund if you want something more tailored to your age and how close you are to retirement all you have to do is calculate what year you turn 60 and round to the closest year ending in five or zero then pick the target date fund with that year in it my favorite analogy about investing is that it's like walking into a grocery store everybody has a different vehicle to hold their goodies some grab a basket other grab the mini carts other grab full-size carts and heck some people just hold all of their food in their arms some people being me they come into the store with money and then buy things at the store AKA when you're investing you choose an account to hold your Investments you put cash into the account to make those purchases and then you buy stuff but what if you've watched this entire video and you're still thinking to yourself dang I still don't really get it consider investing through a robo advisor this is the simplest set it and forget it investing method so if you're lazy but you want to eventually be rich and get your bag please pay attention I'm going to teach you how Robo advisors are just like your Spotify so you know how Spotify uses your listening data to help build you the perfect playlist you got stuff like discover weekly daily mix release radar well Robo advisors do the same thing except for your Investments you fill out a short survey about your goals risk tolerance and financial situation and then they build you a personalized and diversified investment strategy if you don't have the time or the willpower to learn how to best on your own this is a superb way to still invest without confusing yourself my only flag is that Robo advisors do typically charge an additional fee for human advisors they charge around one percent to manage your money but good Robo advisors charge about a quarter of that so 0.25 or less while you'll pay more in fees to use a robo advisor than if you were to invest on your own if you know yourself and don't think you'll invest period unless someone else does it for you this is still a great option to wrap up this video I want to remind you of two important points by parking your money in a checking account you're losing wealth as the years go on because inflation is going to make your life more expensive and unless you're making upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year you can't realistically save your way to Rich you need to invest your money if you plan on retiring and two please be gentle with yourself just because you haven't invested yet does not mean you're bad with money you are not stupid you're not behind you just haven't ever been taught we pride ourselves on dragging kids through school for 12 years math reading Science History but we don't teach personal finance when it's actually the most important subject that actually impacts every single person I hope this video was able to teach you a little something you never got in class and also gives you the hope that no matter who you are you can and deserve to invest make sure to like

encourages more of a competitive environment and I truly love it this week alone we saw codium AI release wind surf IDE which is a new AI gentic IDE that is capable of combining deep code-based understanding with Advanced AI tools to help you develop and code out anything we also also saw the release of a which is a new open- source IDE trying to replicate wind sur's Cascade feature but today we are going back to the IDE that had started the IDE race and that is cursor for the people who do not know cursor is an AI editor that utilizes AI to streamline the development process with AI features like autocomplete code suggestion you have code generation and so much more it's mostly known for its compos comper feature which is cursor composer that allows developers to provide highle instructions for creating entire applications or making complex multifault changes and just today we have a new update called the 0.43 release where there is a new composer UI there's AI agents within the IDE as well as the at recommended function which is something that will semantically search for context this is quite interesting and there's so much more to this so with that thought let's get straight into the video please keep in mind that this update is rolling out meaning that it is not accessible for everyone they're slowly rolling out different access points to various users so just keep that in mind you can still check by going through the next procedure which I'll Showcase in The Next Step I'm going to go ahead and showcase how you can install the new update for the people who have cursor already installed if you do not you can easily just install it off of their website or you can install it for your operating system but now for the people who already have an older version of cursor you can install the new version by simply typing in control or command shift p and this will basically open up the search Tab and then you can easily search for cursor attempt update you can just simply click on this and this will install the latest release of the cursor update let's get started now and take a look at the key features in the cursor 0 43 release starting off with the new composer UI features we now have the composer as a tab where the composer is accessible through the command shift I feature and it's now integrated as a tab in your editor just like any file would be this is actually a huge step forward compared to the old overlay UI which is offering a more intuitive and cohesive workspace for developers this feature of the inline diffs is quite quite big cuz this basically means that it is now going to show directly within the composer chat and it's going to allow you to review changes on the fly so you can accept them right there or choose to open the file for further edits and this will overall streamline the whole review process next up we have the composer agent which is a powerful feature that is going to enhance your coding workflow now this is a pretty big update because composer is going to now bring advanced AI capabilities and this will basically allow for autonomously picking the right context for a task it's going to allow you to interact with the terminal for Automation and debugging and it's going to seamlessly integrate into your existing development process you can easily enable the composer agent by going directly into your composer chat window you can open this chat and you can toggle the agent on and off now you can also do this through the settings where you can navigate through the settings go over to to the editor and then you can head over to chat and composer and you can set the enable tool option to activate the composer agent just take a look at this demo video of this new agent in action you can see that it is being requested to build and run the project that has been provided as context and you can see that it has already analyzed a couple of errors and it's going to go ahead and install the necessary packages for you and in this case it's doing everything autonomously it's it's going to install and create multif files that are necessary for this project it's going to then develop the project by generating the code for it and it's going to also install the necessary packages all by running terminal commands directly in line which you can see right here and at the end you're going to see that it's going to be capable of generating this app for the Mac OS operating system but you see right here now another cool feature is that they have improved semantic search which is a great Improvement that makes the composer agent find files easier with just a few characters and it's going to do it faster and more intuitively it works quite well and it works similarly to vs code search which is going to ensure that there's consistently going to be able to recall the best context that is available there's also this new image dropping experience where they have basically enhanced this by having you hover a file over the composer chat box and it will basically trigger a color change there's no major functional difference but it's just a visual cue that adds a small touch to this enhancement there's also a new pill recommendation in the chat SL composer which is basically something that we haven't seen yet but we're going to soon be able to get a good idea of what this is once they roll out with this update now there's this new feature that isn't actually written in the ch change log it's an experimental feature that's called the bugfinder and essentially it's helping you identify potential bugs in your code but this is something that is quite expensive to actually run they have a warning that states this that it's an experimental feature costs can be very high per run and they also stated that bookfinder analyzes code changes between your current branch and the main branch in your remote repository the best results run it on a feature branches before merging into the main the C potential issues early in deployment there's a lot of small things like the Improvement of efficiency where they've made the composer more accurate and it's more polished with less bugs there's also near instant code application and there's enhanced code context understanding where it's going to be able to better analyze and utilize code context and it's going to deliver more accurate recommendations and act actions so at the end of the day this new composer feature is definitely great with the addition of Agents but cursor just seems to keep on elevating the platform and with competition Rising they're definitely on their uh I would say toes because they're forced to keep on pushing and innovating better releases but that's essentially it for today's video on the new cursor 0.43 release now I'm definitely going to be making another video which showcases the agent in action where I'm going to be building functional applications with this so definitely stay tuned as this is something that is going to be revolutionary now I'll leave all the links that I use in today's video in the description below make sure you follow me on the patreon so that you can access

Trump's economic team are pushing for a total reorganization of the international financial system the so-called Mara Lago accord named after the president's resort in Florida aims to tilt the international economy in favor of the United States as part of the scheme the White House would reclassify trading partners into friends and enemies and deliberately devalue the US dollar this is Mara Lago the Florida resort where Donald Trump spends many weekends often with high-profile guests and senior administration officials now lending its name to a bold and potentially destabilizing economic plan the plan aims to devalue the US dollar a symbol of American financial might but according to Donald Trump's economic team the dollar is too strong too many countries want to hold dollars in reserve and that according to the White House team creates a lot of problems a strong dollar makes imports cheaper for US customers and makes US exports more expensive the White House sees that as hurting US manufacturing hollowing out the working class and making the country more dependent on others rather than making things at home in the USA then there's the US national debt well over $30 trillion the annual interest payments are more than the military budget china and other countries sell a lot more goods in the US than they import than they invest in US debt driving up the dollar even more so how do Trump's economists want to fix this with what's being called the Mara Lago accord a framework's been suggested by Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant and the head of Trump's economic advisory council the idea is to convince other countries to help weaken the dollar and to trade in their US debt holdings for 100year bonds the US would pay way less interest on its debt this isn't something most countries would see as being in their self-interest so how do you convince other countries to act against their financial interests bessent has suggested dividing countries into three categories green for friendly nations red for unfriendly ones and yellow for those in the middle green countries would receive military protection and tariff relief those that don't play along will have high tariffs and no military aid explicitly linking America's military might to its financial power making other countries literally pay for protection one major risk is that more and more countries might turn to China or other nations for trade deals and military stability rather than pay the price to stay friends with the US it's also hard to tell if Trump who often seems to change his mind and reverse course announcing tariffs and then pausing them will stick with any policy for long but the so-called Mara Lago accords do point to a method behind what can otherwise look like a series of impulsive decisions jesse Yin is an assistant director at the Atlantic Council's geoeconomic center she recently wrote an article about this issue for the Atlantic Council called Meeting in Mara Lago is a new currency deal applausible welcome to DW so should we be viewing the Trump administration's changed military priorities and widespread use of tariffs through the lens of this Marilago accord is this the Trump administration getting its ducks in a row well that's certainly one way to look at it and it's really a debate in DC right now about whether these tactics will be feasible in trying to get a weaker US dollar so the Mara Lago accord is also a play on the Plaza Accord from 1985 where West Germany France Japan the United Kingdom and the US came together to intentionally devalue the US dollar and how did that work out so these countries did come to a currency agreement to devalue the US dollar especially against the Japanese yen something that we at the geoeconomic center kind of identified in our article is that the countries that signed onto this agreement and that held these large trade deficits with the US um have very different incentives in 1985 than the countries that currently hold large trade deficits with the US like China Mexico and Vietnam in 1985 the US was providing the security guarantee for these countries meanwhile countries like China Mexico and Vietnam don't have the same incentives to sign on to a currency agreement and that's where uh some of Trump's advisers have come in with this idea of tariffs as a way to bring countries to the negotiation table and is this actively being considered in the White House um I think we kind of have to wait and see uh how far they can sort of push this along a lot of the these concepts come from a report that Steven Mirren who uh is part of Trump's circle of adviserss right now put out last year in September but we're going to have to sort of wait and see uh whether the Trump administration moves forward in exactly this way and and can you answer the question you raised in your article is a new currency deal plausible it would be very difficult and one sticking point is China china is a much bigger player in the global economy nowadays than it was in 1985 it holds the largest trade deficit with the US and the sort of lingering impression of the Plaza Accord in China is a cautionary tale um a lot of people believe that the depreciation of or the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the US dollar led to the bursting of the Japanese e asset bubble and the sort of slow lagging economic growth that Japan has had since the '90s um so in that way with China's own economy sort of slowing down they don't feel incentivized to really appreciate the reimb in any meaningful way okay so if China as you say one of the the biggest holders of US debt if they say no one are interested how big a hole does that put in in the president's plan um I believe that it would put quite a big hole in his plan um the sort of continued and intentional devaluation of the US dollar would bring sort of domestic economic instability as well as destabilizing the global trade system um it would be very difficult to sort of sustain that this does seem like an odd plan from a president who during his first term kept accusing China of manipulating its currency now it looks as though that's exactly what Donald Trump wants to do um it's hard to say whether uh this will actually get pushed through but the idea around a strong dollar versus a weak dollar um a lot of it does come down to these trade deficits um but President Trump has also said that he doesn't want to give up the dominance of the dollar within reserves so there are a few different crossroads of purposes here so if this Marilago accord happens you how does it affect current countries whose currencies are tied to the dollar and as we've mentioned those who who bought American debt do they do they just bystanders uh to this um especially if the Trump administration goes the way of uh implementing more tariffs and tries to go through this unilaterally um a lot of countries would just sort of have to accept how the dollar moves in the market and how does it then affect their economies i'm I'm I'm looking for the sort of the ripple effect of this i mean it would be largely destabilizing um if we look at the historical comparison after um the countries in the plaza accord sort of agreed to devalue the US dollar they eventually gave it up um a few years later and G7 countries have sort of agreement since mid2010s to not engage in these sort of currency agreements anymore and if this happened would it work would it bring more jobs to the United States global trading system and supply chains are a lot more intertangled now than they were so similar to the question of will tariffs bring US uh jobs back and manufacturing it's more of a wait and see I would say okay thanks for that Jesse Yin from the Atlantic Council thank you so much", "duration(in seconds)": 573.0, "region": "US"}}

one but it's not your average Quantum chip they claim to have created an entirely new state of matter so now we have solid liquid gas plasma and the new kit on the Block the too computer or topological supercomput it is entirely a new state of matter if it turns out not to be your typical Microsoft BS and that's a big if it could be a breakthrough on par with the transistor The Humble transistor allowed computers to scale up to millions of bits and the Topo computer could be the technology that allows us to scale up to millions of cubits without exaggeration that would make computers billions of times faster than current Tech allowing us to do incredible things like develop new medicines ass simulate entire worlds of AI girlfriends and run Microsoft Windows updates in seconds instead of hours in today's video we'll look at the crazy science behind Microsoft's Meer on a one ship and find out if it'll finally make quantum computers not suck so much it is February 21st 2025 and you're watching the code report one of the worst things that ever happened to me in my entire life was when I upgraded from Windows XP to Windows Vista in 2007 it was a traumatizing experience but it changed my life and got me to start using Linux today my PTSD was triggered when I saw that Microsoft was hyping up this new Quantum chip because as of today it's utterly useless for all practical purposes however it could be a significant breakthrough that gets us to quantum computers in years not decades according to CEO Saia Nutella this announcement comes just weeks after Google announced its Willow chip which itself is also useless but made a significant breakthrough through an error correction rates what's interesting though is that the Myer on one ship uses a fundamentally different architecture it's based on the myeron a fon which is a subatomic particle that's also its own anti particle like an electron has a negative charge and then it has an opposite partner called a positron and when they meet they annihilate each other what's weird about the myana particle though is that it's like a mere image of itself there's no positive or negative side and that makes it resistant to decoherence which is where things get really weird quantum computers rely on Quantum properties like superposition and entangle that allows cubits to represent the probability of multiple ones and zeros at the same time but the problem is that cubits are extremely delicate and affected by their environment through a process called Quantum decoherence they gradually lose these cool properties and collapse to a regular classical State it's like trying to get a choir to sing in Perfect Harmony in a war zone that creates high error rates in quantum computers and what's special about the myona feron is that it's highly resistant to decoherence this weird subatomic particle was first theorized in 1937 but wasn't actually observed until 2020 when researchers found them in islands of gold and actually Microsoft claimed to have seen them back in 2018 but they had to retract This research paper when it was found that they misrepresented the results but now just a few years later Microsoft is claiming they can not only observe them but also control them they released a paper describing topological Quantum Computing where they braid and fuse these particles together and then measure them all of which occurs on a nanowire that's engineered atom by atom basically you have these myeron a zero modes at either end of the wire then to compute things they measure if there's an even or odd number of electrons in the wire the end result is a new type of semiconductor called a topo conductor which is basically a superconductor semiconductor sandwich where the semiconductor mimics the superconductor and these can be chained together to scale up to millions of cubits on a small chip like this the chip does need to be kept at a temperature of near absolute zero and although they say it can scale up to millions of cubits they haven't actually done that yet as of today it appears that Google and IBM are far ahead in the quantum Computing race but Microsoft played the long game here and they're really the only big company that's taking the topological approach and if they're not just overhyping it like the Microsoft Kin then it could actually change the world and that means as programmers will'll need to rewrite every line of code to optimize for Quantum hardware and an awesome tool that can help you review all

So there is a reason \nTrump might be doing this on purpose. Now,   I'm not married to this idea. It's conceivable \nthat through a combination of not understanding   what he's doing and wanting to appear tough, \nTrump is kind of blindly going into this seemingly   obvious economy crashing set of policies. But \nthere's another possibility here, which is we   see the Dow drop. thirteen hundred points in two \ndays after Trump launched this reckless trade war,   the tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China. We see \nstock prices tumbling, companies warning of higher   costs, Wall Street panicking. Just got a report \nminutes before I came into the studio today about   hiring, slowing down. But the thing is, it may \nnot be incompetence. This could be a deliberate   opportunity for the ultra wealthy, because when \nthe stock market tanks. And many people start   panicking and selling their investments. I advise \nagainst it, OK? It's actually an opportunity to   just hold steady, keep buying at lower costs. The \nbillionaires know it. They see the fire sale. They   sit on cash. They wait for stocks and land and \nbusinesses, even public assets to crash in value.   And then they come in and they buy them really \ninexpensively. And the worst that Donald Trump   makes the economy, the bigger the opportunity \nfor his rich friends. and the oligarchical robber   barons. We have seen this before. Think back to \n2008, Wall Street wrecked the economy. Millions   of people lost homes, but who benefited? You had \nthe private equity firms, the hedge funds buying   up foreclosed properties, turning them into rental \nempires, jacking up rents. We've covered it before   and the same thing potentially could be playing \nout right now because if the stock market keeps   falling. Working class Americans lose their 401ks. \nThe billionaires get to buy blue chip stocks at   a discount and buy up for closed properties at \na fraction of their market value. And it's not   only about that, it's also about the big P word, \nwhich one am I talking about? Privatization. The   right wing playbook has always been create a \ncrisis, convince people that the The system is   failing. and then swoop in to offer a privatized \nalternative that benefits corporations. Look at   social security. For years, Republicans have \nlied about social security being on the verge   of collapse. What it really would be is if we \nchange nothing in a bunch of years, it would   only be able to afford to pay 80 % of benefits, \nsomething which we can fix with just some small   tweaks. Why do they want to manufacture a crisis \naround social security? because then they can   justify gutting it. and handing your retirement \nover to Wall Street. Take the post office, Trump   and his cronies who sabotaged the UPS, USPS during \nTrump's first term, slowed down mail delivery,   said, look at how this dysfunctional this whole \nthing is. And then they go, well, you know what?   This might be better provided by private companies \nlike UPS, FedEx and DHL. Let's privatize mail.   It's the same old trick over and over again. And \nnow Trump is doing it with the entire economy. He   stokes the chaos with the tariffs. He spooks \ninvestors. He causes a downturn. And then he   and his billionaire allies can claim, look, the \neconomy's struggling. Let's deregulate everything.   Let's privatize public assets. Let's let the \nfree market handle it. And by the way, I'd be   interested. They go. It is not a coincidence that \nTrump's biggest donors are the same billionaires   who thrive when you've got an economic downturn. \nIt's Blackstone, Black Rock, Goldman Sachs,   real estate tycoons, private equity firms waiting \nfor assets to become dirt cheap in a deregulatory   environment so they can buy them, consolidate \nwealth and then sell them back in some cases to   the very people who lost them. So the question we \nare left to ask, I don't know the answer. Maybe   it's a why not both. Is Trump wildly incompetent \nand irrational or is he deliberately creating   the conditions for another billionaire feeding \nfrenzy? because every time Trump breaks something,   his rich friends happen to be right there ready \nto cash in on the backs of people who really don't   have the money to lose. This applies to a lot of \ndifferent things, including Trump's crypto scam.   So maybe it's both. Maybe Trump is wildly \nincompetent, but also wildly selfish. Either way,   this has billionaire robber barons written all \nover it. Let me know which you think it is.", "duration(in seconds)": 392.0, "region": "US"}}

\"Trumponomics\" as it appears he has no understand how money and economics work at all.", "tags": "the, bulwark, thebulwark", "script": "hey guys it's Tim Miller from the bullwark there's an editorial out this morning from The Wall Street Journal called Trump ecomics and Rising inflation I wanted to share with you guys you know sometimes some people might come to this feed and be like that guy hates Donald Trump he's a never Trumper you know what he's saying about the plans that Donald Trump is putting forth is colored by his views okay um that's possible uh I I certainly admit to having a tinge of trump derangement syndrome and so that's why I also like to show you guys uh critiques that are coming from people that are credulous when it comes to Donald Trump that have been Pro Donald Trump that like attack Democrats uh to a degree that is sometimes irrational and that is the Wall Street Journal editorial board this is not uh the the news side of the paper the news side of the paper is I think plays it pretty straight down the midle the editorial board um has been for a long time uh essentially you know the newspaper mouthpiece for uh Republican Economic Policy um uh they have crushed Democrats across the board are always defending Republicans efforts to you know cut taxes uh to cut Social Services and so when the Wall Street Journal comes out and says that Trump's economic plans don't make sense that's something that we should listen to and think about what it is that and think about why they're making the case that they are so uh I want to pull up uh some of this uh article for you um it begins like this does President Trump understand money not money is in cash but the supply of money the price of money as measured by interest rates and their impact on inflation the W jal's answer is that it would appear to be no I could tell the Wall Street Journal that uh it's shouldn't have taken them till February 13th 2025 to realize that Donald Trump doesn't actually understand how money supply Works uh he understands how to con people out of their money uh but I'm glad they've come come around to that realization uh probably when it's too late uh here after his second election uh but uh what what was it that prompted this rebuke uh it was a comment yesterday from Trump calling for lower interest rates uh the interest rates will come down you said that you would demand that the interest rates come down well I would I would put in a strong statement do you expect the FED to listen to you yeah Trump sent out a bleet that was basically bullying Federal Reserve Drome pal saying that you should lower interest rates uh so people can get a cheaper price on their mortgage uh get cheaper prices on other borrowing now I would love for there to be lower interest rates I would love to refinance on my house we moved to New Orleans after interest rates went up and so we're paying a higher interest rate on our mortgage than uh we were in California and and that's causing our mortgage to be more expensive than I wish it should be there are a lot of people out there that are going through this there are a lot of people out there who are trying to sell homes who are struggling to sell their home because the market is soft because people don't want to buy homes when interest rates are this high so like the Instinct of trump to say interest rates should be lowered I get it like when you talk about inflation and what is crunching people uh mortgage rates and interest rates broadly are one of the big reasons it's not just the price at the pump and at the grocery store it's also that people feel um you know either stuck in their home you know or uh for those who've purchased homes more recently uh they feel like they're like they're paying a mortgage rate that is exorbitant uh this this has an impact on rents this has an impact on young people who are now trying to get into the housing market um it is so it's it's correct that these high interestes have a negative consequence but here's the problem the interest rates are up uh as a way to try to Tamp down inflation and we this news that I covered yesterday with samstein that inflation has ticked back up so if you're as the Wall Street Journal says the president's call for easier money during a time when consumer prices keep Rising means that he's calling for higher prices they ask rhetorically does he want even higher prices and I can answer this question for them no he just doesn't know what the he's doing all right he doesn't want higher prices he just doesn't understand any of this he doesn't understand inflation he just he he just wants stock market go up interest prices go down Donald Trump takes people's money from his first fake shitcoin right like that's that's what Trump wants okay um he wants the Easy Street he does not want uh and none of his policies in addition to the uh demands for cutting interest rates whether it's tariffs uh whether it's less immigration whether it's the massive tax cut that I talked to Brendan Bole about yesterday that they're proposing all of that is inflationary if you put that all together let's say you got what you want it and the interest rates go down a huge tax cut goes in uh um goes into effect particularly for the wealthiest um tariffs are put in place on goods and we limit the supply of workers uh because of deportations and uh capping immigration like that is the recipe for permanent Perman inflation um and so like on the one issue that he you know supposedly got elected on all of his proposals are doing the opposite of what people say they want which is cheaper prices hey YouTube fam if you want to support the bull workk the best way to do it is by becoming a YouTube bullwark plus member the bull workk is truly independent we have no corporate overlords we're not settling any dumb lawsuits with Trump by joining you help support our work and you can get a bunch of perks right here on this platform ad free content bonus videos live streams and some emojis of me which I guess some people want so come join come hang out become a bull workk YouTube plus member and I'll be seeing you in the comments so behave back to the Wall Street Journal so on this point they say as a political matter and inflation Revival may be the biggest threat to the Trump presidency Trump was elected as voters reacted to inflation and falling real incomes under Joe Biden real average earnings are flat over the last three months as inflation has bounced up if this persists Trump won't have a 53% job approval rating for long so I mean that just kind of sums up where we're at on this the uh Wall Street Journal say what you want about them that they've been cowardly that they've accommodated Trump that they've gone along with him that they have uh some pretty um unpopular views uh when it comes to you know cutting spending and paying for that by giving more money to Wall Street robber barons uh you know there's plenty of they they said a lot of untrue things like uh there's plenty of things to criticize The Wall Street Journal about but here's something the people at the Wall Street Journal people Wall Street Journal editorial board at least like understand how markets work how monetary policy works right and they are sending a flashing red light to Donald Trump that says what you are doing is only going to increase costs and only going to lead to Greater inflation I don't expect that Donald Trump is going to listen listen to them I expect that he will continue to bully jome pal that he will continue to reduce the supply of workers uh through deportations and less uh immigration that he'll continue to drive up costs on goods via tariffs and that he'll continue to put the push through his massive tax um uh tax decrease uh and all that together is going to mean continued higher prices for all of us so that's latest when you get a chance to say you got to hand it to the Wall Street Journal well usually I don't take that chance but today I'm going to take it you are correct editorial board everybody else subscribe to this feed uh as new stuff

speech, donald trump news, presidential election, donald trump latest news, trump latest news, stocks", "script": "well the election results are in and Donald Trump has been declared the next president and we've seen the S&P 500 as well as the overall stock market shoot to all-time highs as a result of investor confidence and the question you may now have is will this continue should you pull back in fact I got this question right here saying Bob what should we do in this case should we just bask in the glory of the stock market at an all-time high or should we just keep on investing because Warren Buffett he says be fearful when people are greedy and right now it feels like greed has taken over ever since the announcement of Donald Trump as the next president what a great question and what we're going to do today in this video we need to look back to 2016 when he got elected but we also need to look at just overall what may or may not happen so there's a lot of things on the table and this is not a political Channel this is a personal finance channel so we're going to stick to the facts and we're going to stick to personal finance only and the the big thing though there's a lot of promises when it comes down to personal income tax corporate tax tariffs and so much more and it could either be positive and be a great thing or there could be headwinds therefore making this all very challenging for the government and for the president to make those promises actually come true as a result the stock market is going to react however it's going to react so a couple things could happen here um the very first thing that people are very much focused on is the perz if that's even a word of the 2017 tax cuts this is a big deal back in 2017 we had the tax cut and jobs act those and a lot of those were set to expire in 2025 now with Trump coming back into office we can expect that to be permanent because he's going to set it to be permanent now that impacts a lot because if you were around for that period of time and and you took a look at your paycheck you should have seen a reduction in your taxes and and more money coming for your take-home pay if you run a business you probably saw a little bit of bump on the positive end of take-home pay from that too reducing taxes that's all great it also increased significantly the standard deduction so when you go to file your taxes your standard deduction is much higher than it used to be prior to 2017 there's a big push on what would offset that so when you do reduction of taxes when you put on things that benefit you know on on the surface benefit a lot of middle income taxpayers when you reduce the tax on overtime PID like he is mentioning in his campaign promise what is the offset to maintain revenue for the government because otherwise what you're doing is you're running up the national deficit now there's two ways you could do this you find ways to increase revenue on another Spectrum maybe that is the tariffs like he's mentioning or maybe that's some other way of increasing revenue or you find ways to cut cost cut government spending to reduce the national deficit there has to be one trade-off to the other you you can't just have both going up because that again will run up the debt of the country but what happens to our investment accounts because to the big question of should we keep on investing or are we in a massive greed territory because we're at an all-time high of the stock market I think it' be wise to take a trip back to 2016 and see what happens knowing that these headwinds of what could or could not happen in the future could make this all just a facade or make it even better than what it is let's hop over to the screen and take a look so I don't know about you but when I opened my account after uh you know this past uh Wednesday and Thursday I absolutely loved what I saw if you feel the same go ahead and drop a comment down below how excited are you how much money or percentage are you up as a result of your investment that is obviously what the big buzz is right now and can it continue so here's where we are in the year 2016 now this is looking at BO Vanguard S&P 500 top 500 companies this is the measure of the stock market okay so if we look here on this beautiful chart we can see that uh you know we're we're right around what is that 19 196 per share back here on Halloween of 2016 and we kind of dropped down quite significantly here all the way down to 191 right before the election and then look we get this massive jump up to 1999 it shoots up in fact if you look at this dayto day it's up 2% 46 and then up 1.07% so it does this it jumps up not maybe as much as now but it is still a good jump from what it was trending at just beforehand you can kind of see it was Flatline and then we had a nice little pop now here's the thing to think about will this in 2024 2025 2026 repeat what happened in 2016 as we come forward so look at this at 199 and it shoots up by the time we're here and and it's still not 2017 this is still president elect territory we're now up to 206 we come forward here and now now we're in 2017 way over here and the price is right around 208 it then kind of flatlines pops up a little bit here in January and it keeps running up all the way here to March which is 221 so if you would have bought in and you would have been a little bit aggressive in that earlier or later part I should say of 2016 by February of 2017 you're now up quite an amount of money especially if you put a lot of money into the investment so the trick happens of looking at the same lens if we go back here to where this all happened you may think whoa this just really ran up can it really run up more should I wait until the stock market comes back down before I put money in and it's really tricky because we don't know what's on the other end see here we have the benefit of scrolling over here to the right but right now we're kind of kind of stuck right here we don't know what's after right now will it go up or will there be some headwinds will there be a recession will there be some some things that cannot be controlled by any government and we just got to deal with it could we see negative earnings start coming out putting pressure on the stock market because the companies cannot continue to just outperform the stock market which means that they're not reporting earnings that match the valuation of the stock market it's going to naturally pull down the stock market market so there's a lot of things that we don't see on the other end yet we do here so what we could assume is could there be a potential that this continues to run up and if so if you wait for it to come back down you might be missing out because if you say well it's $199 right now and I feel that this is going to come back down to let's say 180 I'm going to wait for 180 and I'm going to buy in while you were out of luck my friend because if I scroll all the way from 2018 2019 to March 2020 when we had the the co pandemic that that brought the stock market down it it only comes down here to 200 so what would have happened there's your 199 so it basically reset itself it never got to 180 so what would happen is you're sitting on cash that whole time and you're not taking advantage of the opportunity that really comes forward where it's coming up and right right here look at this it goes up to $311 a share so by waiting and waiting you're missing out on all these gains all these dividends all these things that happen in the stock market cuz you're waiting for the right time so what could be happening here as we soll forward and see a similar trend is potentially the same thing as you see right here we're at 2.49% 78 and44 very very similar looking to the 2016 map is it not could we see the same type of thing happen now we're looking at 549 by the way if you invested at 199 a share and you're right now at 549 on vo you're feeling really good right now but this is where we as smart investors need to come up with a plan and stick to the plan regardless of who the president is it doesn't matter what it needs to matter is what does your outlook look like from an overall economic perspective now because of Donald Trump's history in business because of his promises to reduce taxes and really to fuel a lot of American economic growth there's a lot of confidence in the stock market and if this continues to happen where we're popping off the next couple years could see some beautiful beautiful gains like we did from 2016 all the way up to March of 2020 here's a study done by Charles Schwab and I love this study because it looks at four actually sorry five different people take a look here so even bad Market timing Trump's inertia so the the really cool thing here is we're looking at $2,000 annually as a hypothetical portfolio that tracks the S&P 500 Index from 2001 to 2020 at and the individual who never bought stocks at all look at that all the way over there on the right they don't have any money to show for it but if the people that just do the dollar cost averaging or invest immediately when they get their money look at how that works because we know on the left-hand side even though we all want to be perfect with our timing we are not psychics I don't care who you are you're just not and and you know to to time it perfectly every single time is going to be very difficult but I think even the bad timing looks pretty good compared to just sitting on cash Because by the time you think it's time to invest it's already too late and you are looking pretty weak so what's your prediction is the stock market going to keep going up as a result of the Trump presidency or is there going to be headwinds and therefore the market will reverse this time around drop your thoughts down below check out this video next and we'll see you on the next video", "duration(in

living expenditures Financial experts normally advise saving 20 of your pay to help you achieve this goal this may not be a quick thing some people take several months or years to save up enough for a rainy day fund but don't get unmotivated if you look at the big picture it will be the emergency fund that saves you in trying times continue allocating as much as you can preferably at least 20 percent to this goal four reduce debt to prevent debt from spiraling out of control don't spend more than you earn of course that's often easier said than done and the truth is most people must borrow from time to time also going into debt can occasionally be advantageous for example if it leads to the acquisition of an asset taking out a mortgage to buy a property is an example of this still take a hard look at what items you're obligating yourself to paying off if it is not debt that allows you to build an asset or something that helps you bring in income be very cautious about obligating yourself to paying it back this includes things like cars Tech appliances and any Myriad of items that you're tempted to put on your credit card five investing investing is the acquisition of assets

to be terrible at handstands but now I can easily hold it for over 30 seconds because of this method I'm about to teach you first this might be obvious but working on your handstands puts a lot of pressure on your wrists so properly warm them up by moving and stretching them now we are going to build strength and learn how to balance on our hands with two exercises first try what I like to call a TP kneel on the floor and place your hands shoulder width apart right in front of your knees from there straighten your legs into a downward dog position start to lean forward which will likely pull you up onto your toes the goal is to eventually hold most of your body weight in your arms and hands using your feet mostly for balance next if you can try practicing your balance in a frogstand place your hands in front of you and then open to a wide squat lean forward and bend your elbow slightly allow them to fit in the crooks of your knees when you feel secure lean forward even more than point your toes which should allow you to now be balanced solely on your hands use this as an opportunity to practice shifting your weight and using your hands to keep you balanced next let's break down proper technique and what each body part should be doing in a handstand starting with hands place them shoulder width apart and spread your fingers wide you do not want flat hands but instead to look like you are gripping the floor with crunched fingertips you also want the majority of your body weight and balance to be placed in your fingers not back on your palms as for your arms keep these tight and straight moving onto shoulders it is crucial that you keep them shrugged think like when you make this I don't know movement you're pulling your shoulders up to your ears in a handstand this is what relax shoulders look like versus when they're shrugged again here's an example of relax shoulders versus shrugged or where your head is placed tilt your head slightly up and look at your hands you don't wanna stick it out or even have a neutral head but enough tilt to make direct eye contact with your fingers finally we're going to talk about body and leg placement and learn about a stack the key to a good handstand if you have access to this find a large elevated surface that is above knee and below hip level like a mat or a bed kneel on the edge and lean over placing your hands on the ground straighten your legs to a TP and find the point where your hips shoulders and hands are in a stacked line film yourself from the side to see if you hit this position here are a\ncouple of examples of what a break in the stack line looks like notice how one or more pieces of my body sticks out from this line when you are doing this stack correctly and feel like you are balanced without moving anything else try lifting one leg at a time and balancing eventually again not moving anything in the stack try lifting a second leg and balancing which may take some time in practice here's a visual example of how sensitive the stack is if you watch this closely you can see how I ever so slightly shifted my hips back which ruined the stack and caused me to it's easier to learn from the mat but alternatively you can also try this on a wall sit so that your feet are flat against the wall and your legs are straight Mark where your hands are supposed to go by placing your fingers in line with where your butt is sitting climb up the wall and find your stack your hips and legs should be a little more open than a 90 degree angle again practice bringing one leg off the wall notice my foot against the wall is pointed when you have a good balance and feel like there's almost no way against that foot flex it if you're in the correct stack this should result in you holding a balanced handstand when you're ready to take this off the wall avoid kicking up from standing in a lunge because this is less controlled instead I highly suggest starting with both hands on the ground and kicking up which is much easier to help you find that stack I also recommend continuing to hold from this slight split since it is just so much easier to balance and adjust from thank you guys so much for watching I hope this really helps your handstands and subscribe to stay tuned for more tutorials and gymnastics slash tumbling related videos", "duration(in seconds)": 201.0, "region": "US"}}

In his first six weeks of the second term. New CNN polling out just this morning, showing that Americans are not happy with how President Trump is handling the economy right now. And that's even before the major market selloff that we've seen this week. But still, on some key issues, he is seeing some of his best numbers of his entire presidential career. Joining us right now, CNN, Washington bureau chief and political director David Shelton. Thanks for waking up early, David. Let's start with the overall approval rating in this moment. Where does it stand for President Trump? We have President Trump in our brand new poll at 45% approval. This is for his handling of his job. Overall, 54% disapproval. So upside down obviously underwater Kate. But look at that 45% number over time for Donald Trump in his entire first term. That was his high watermark that we had in CNN polling. It appeared in eight years ago, March 2017, around this time, in his first time around and towards the end of his presidency, at the beginning of Covid, will rally around the president moment in May of 2020. That's when he hit 45%. He left office with a 34% approval rating in 2021. So this 45% that he's at right now. That was his actual high watermark last time around. Yeah I mean it's like underwater. But better than better than he's done. the economy of course, remains an issue, top of mind and of concern for most Americans, likely only getting more top of mind and more of concern. What are Americans saying in this poll about how they think the president is handling all of this? With a relevant note that this poll was conducted, began and ended before the massive stock stock market selloff that we've seen this week. Yes, but not before the chaos we've seen over the last three weeks. And I think that is reflected in the numbers here. You are right. The economy is issue number one by far for Americans, as indicated in this poll. His approval rating on this issue is 44%. Trump's disapproval rating 56% of Americans disapprove of his handling of the economy. We've never seen him that far. underwater and upside down in terms of approval and disapproval on this issue in his entire presidential career. look here, it's usually a strong suit for him. You see, we've had him at 44% approval before, but never with 56% disapproval. So that 12 point, you know, -12 point spread, if you will, that's the largest on issue number one for Americans we've ever had him in our polling. So how are people feeling more broadly than not just about the president, his hand and more broadly about the Trump administration so far? Take a look. You noted at the top some of his scores on some issues are the best he's ever had. Immigration. He's a majority approval. 51% of Americans approve of what Donald Trump is doing on immigration. he's close to half, on managing the federal government and the federal budget. But, you see, there's his overall job approval, 45%. We were talking about the economy right there at 44%. Health care policy, foreign affairs and tariffs. Only 39% approve of the way Donald Trump is handling tariffs. We also asked, how are things going in the country today. And take a look, Kate 35% say, well, 65% say badly. But good news for this white House potentially in January that 35% number was 29%. So a little bit of an uptick in the last month in in the perception of people saying how things are going in the country, there really is a lot in this poll to consider and a lot of nuance in how Americans are feeling about their federal government and how they're interacting with it right now. And Trump's handling. Be very interesting how the President Trump himself interprets us. We have the new CNN polling this morning, and there's a lot of interesting stuff in here. He President Trump has a 45% approval rating, a 54% job, a job disapproval that matches in terms of approval that matches his highest rating of his first term. And he's getting big marks in areas like handling of immigration. 51% approve of what he's doing, and that's seven points higher than any point in his first term. And then here's the but then you look at the issue that people care most about the economy. 56% disapprove worse than any point in his first term. If you were still sitting in the white House and you see this, what's what's your take from this? I think there's a several points to kind of breakdown. One is that the president's greatest foil has been the Democrats and their in effect, this to have a message. And again, when you see like the state of the Union speech and Al Green shaking a cane like an angry old man, I think it gives the president much of an advantage. I think some of those numbers reflected the fact that he's a tremendous contrast to the Joe Biden presidency. They see an energetic president taking action. I think they elected him on two principle issues the border and the economy. So the border, I think they like seen it. I think when Democrats take positions in support of the Columbia University protester, I think it continues to elevate that issue. That helps Trump the economy is a big warning sign. I don't totally agree with Karen. I think he has more running room because he still has such control over the party, and members are concerned about being primaried if Donald Trump goes against them, and that gives him a lot more latitude. But I do think it's a warning sign, because that's what they elected him on in large parts in the economy. And if they lose confidence the way he's handling the economy, it's going to continue to drive his numbers down. I mean, just look at the take this podium and look at it through the lens of of a Democrat. Karen, you see this. And Democrats should take take take from take what from it. They should be on offense on the economy. There is no reason to be hemming and hawing, which we're seeing from some of my Democrats. they need to be on offense. They need to be talking about the fact that, again, this is this chaos that we're seeing is created by Republicans, were created by Trump, created by Musk, or compounded by Musk. And the people are starting to say, hey, this is not what we thought we were getting with this second Trump term. And they need to be bullish about it. And and also to stand up to the Republicans and say, we will not accept this C.R. because it is you're not being honest with the American people about what it really does. It actually would give more power and authority to, Trump and Musk to do more damage, to create more chaos, not to mention, just say, because I'm here in DC, the devastating impacts of a $1 billion cut here in Washington where we already don't have enough police officers and firefighters. So I think there's no reason for them not to stand up today. The Senate this is for you, Chuck Schumer, and be bullish about the fact that we have this is this economic chaos has to stop. And they've got to use the little bit of leverage that they have today to try to do something about it. Marc, short thought bubble right now on the CR is like my favorite big right now. Who gets blame? I'm sorry Chris, my EP, he's like please, please I need to take Karen's advice. The Democrats get blamed for a shutdown and stuff and then we'll find out. We may find out our friends Karen's great to see you control everything. A lady is at the white House for us. Elena. Economists are there more than alarmed this morning about what this might mean. But the president, how is he reacting? seeing what happened with the markets yesterday and hearing from some of the top economists to say, hey, if this keeps going, we could find ourselves in a recession. Look, the president seems to be very dug in on tariffs. Not only are we hearing that in some of his public comments, but that's what I'm hearing as well. Privately, in my conversations with white House officials from those close to him advising him on some of this policy, the president really believes that the United States is being taken advantage of. Sarah, he believes that tariffs are negotiating tactic. And he acknowledges, that, you know, obviously the stock market has been on a downward spiral for the last two days. He's erased. It's really erased all the gains we've seen since the president was elected in November. But he believes that if you stick with him, things will go better moving forward. And he even warned yesterday that tariffs could perhaps go even higher. But I want to take a listen to what he said about the stock market, as he's really been kind of continuing to brush off some of that sharply, you know, lower numbers that we've been seeing. Take a listen. Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down. Yeah. But you know what? We have to rebuild our country. So there you have it. He said they're going to go up. They're going to go down. We have to rebuild our country. That is really, again, what I'm hearing behind closed doors, why the president is so dug in on this. But one thing that's been really interesting and what I'm picking up on, I know some other, reports have said this as well as not only with Wall Street, but also those on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in Congress, a lot of people raising the alarm not only about, you know, obviously, Trump's tariff policy, a lot of that is controversial, but also questioning whether there is a bigger strategy here. What is the long term goal on this, and how do they really see the markets stabilizing in the long term? Now, this is, of course, a question as well that many people, many of those business leaders that the president met with yesterday had questions of this is what one of them told our CNN's Jeff Zeleny. They said, quote, there was no new clarity or certainty on what that broader strategy is. Now, we are going to hear from the president today. I'm wearing green. We're going to hear from as well, when he meets with Ireland's, t shock. Essentially, our Prime Minister, I think you can expect a lot of questions on this because, again, the markets are going down. People are seeing their 401 K's on a downward spiral as well. A lot of concerns and a lot of questions and not a lot of clarity from this white House. Other than that they believe in tariffs and they plan to continue moving forward with them.", "duration(in seconds)": 596.0, "region": "US"}}

the highest level since 2010 that's 14 years ago folks credit cards a lot of people are dealing with this right now and it's a very challenging place to be I remember when I was $49,000 in credit card debt it feels like you're suffocating when you're in it credit card defaults in US highest level since 2010 with 46 billion in seriously delinquent loan balance written off in the first 9 months of 2024 a 50% increase from the previous year according to bank W data Mark xandy of Moody's Analytics highlighted the financial strain on lower income consumers stating High income households are fine but the bottom third of us consumers are tapped out their savings rate right now zero Rising credit card balances and interest cost have worsens Financial stress with Americans paying $170 billion in interest over the last 12 months $170 billion just in interest last 12 months credit C balances exceeding $1 trillion for the first time in mid 2023 fueled by post-pandemic spending and inflationary pressures consumer spending power has been diminished says Odessa pampi demitro of wallet hop as delinquency rates remain nearly a percentage Point higher than pre- pandemic levels pointing to more pain ahead credit card charge offs and delinquencies at a 13year high now the story right behind it Tom your thoughts on this year well we've been talking about this m a year ago so we said that the one that the uh credit cards had gone way down uh with um stimulus checks and a lack of spending because you couldn't go out uh outside you you weren't going outside you weren't traveling you weren't going to restaurants so discretionary spending on those sorts of things travel uh amusement parks movies outdoor Leisure and uh you know uh going out to eat were off so people weren't spending on that and they got stimulus checks remember the credit card balance went down to like 500 billion I think it was but then all of a sudden all of a sudden it was time to go back out and play and what did we do we ran those credit cards up and it was earlier this year that we covered on this podcast when the mainstream media wouldn't talk about it because they didn't want to say anything embarrassing to the Biden Administration where credit cards went to a trillion dollars and we called it and we said you know an election year if this inflation doesn't get under control if it doesn't get down to 2% % like drone po one by the way 2% inflation is still inflation it's not zero it just means it gets back down to a a more you know a much lower rate per year so what have what's been happening people have been feeling kind of good they've been going out they've been doing things but the cost of stuff is still up and we're still seeing about restaurants closing why and we're seeing about McDonald's struggling and did the dollar yeah yeah TGI Fridays is is closed so guess what TJ Fridays lives in the middle fast casual they call it like Applebees tji Fridays chili things like that going and you sit down and bankrupt so what we've got right now however the bank stocks seem to be okay really why would the bank stocks be okay do you know how much interest Americans paid over the last 12 months how much on credit cards $170 billion in interest at at an excess of 25% that's the interest rate on credit cards they pay in the last 12 months and it's going down which means this is the opportunity for Trump and one of the big areas you got to get the cost down for people is on energy you bring cost of gas down you can actually anti-infl gasoline and energy and heating oil and also those costs come out of getting all those goods shipped to your grocery store maybe we'll see a little bit of ebbing and price at the grocery store but right now the US uh consumer the bottom third of the US consumers are in a tougher place than they were um at the uh beginning of covid they actually got savings relief during so let me ask you this question Tom if if you look at this chart rob you had the other one as well but let's stay on this one real quick Us credit card write-offs jump 2010 yep that's after' 08 market crash Obama 2010 yep spikes 2024 crash of people spent then they default so what I'm trying to ask you is if if I look at this chart is 2024 2010 or is 2025 going to be 2010 I think 2024 is 20089 and 2025 is going to be 2010 because so so let me get this straight what you just said right there Rob go to the other one it's very important I think what you just said so if you go here I'm asking you if 2024 is 2010 meaning no are we at the peak or is next year Numbers On LAN write offs going to go skyrocketing even harder than 2024 no we're we're the year before 2010 okay I got PE I I'm calling Peak next year because remember Trump I'm kind of with you because if you think about the timeline of covid and what happened with Biden and the economy last 48 months ah yep so and by the way let's look at the impact the world is starving I got to grow corn how long does it take to grow corn that's what you would look into right how long do it take to grow wheat so you can ship bulk well guess what Trump's not Trump will be inaugurated on January 20th then they won't clear all those cabinet picks for another four or five weeks now the cabinet picks especially Treasury and commerce are in place then they put their programs out Congress has got to debate it you're probably talking the middle of Q2 getting into May June before you know what I mean Pat before the corn grows meaning all of the programs from the new cabinet can start having a dramatic impact on on the US worker so what we're seeing here this is a leading indicator of more pain to come on credit card delinquencies um and we are about to find out how much did they spend if you hear that there's a lot of spending uh in Q4 then it's there and by the way guess what we've left out here we were screaming about it and talking about it because it gets left out of the stats what is it four letters begin with a B remember buy now pay later Tom Bingo Y bnpl is hitting sitting below the water like a bigger Iceberg with consumers having a lot of bmpl on top of the credit card stuff I think 25 is going to be our Spike but I think Trump's going to put a lot of things in place with his cabinet to get after it do you ever read the uh the book Tale of Two Cities it was the best of times the best of times it was the worst of times a season of discontent that's what's going on in America today today so what's happening is just as people are struggling inflation interest rates we see what's going on in the economy it's the economy stupid credit card debt delinquencies hit 13-year High ju suppos that with Rob what I sent you if you're an investor if you're playing the Wall Street game versus the Main Street game the stock market is on Pace to have the best twoyear run in the last 25 years Rob if you want to use the the title of that article um stocks on pay for the best two years so if you if you're holding assets if you own real estate if you own stocks you're 401K your index fund your crypto account your Bitcoin you just hit 100,000 we know what's going on with that so people are getting richer and the poor getting poor Pat we we learned a term during Co called the k-shaped economy you did a whole thing about money flows to where the top so people get richer during Co people got stimulus checks what did they all do with their stimulus checks who quickly became the richest man in the world during Co do you remember his name it wasn't Elon Musk Renault it wasn't uh Jeff Bezos exactly it was Bernard Eno who's Bernard Eno he owns a company called LV MH Louis Vuitton Moen Hennessy everyone got them stimy checks and ball till they fall at the mall and now 2 years later they're drowning in credit card debt the average American 2third of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck uh the average credit card debt is $7,000 per consumer the average interest rate is 24% people are struggling but only half of the people are struggling it's the halves versus the have knots half the people are getting richer and half the people are getting poor and it's flip a coin

on HBO, news, vice video, VICE on SHOWTIME, vice news 2022", "script": "by Saturday the pressure on the government was overwhelming with tens of thousands protesting outside the presidential headquarters [Music] at the time this video was filmed Sri Lanka was witnessing unprecedented political turmoil on July 10 thousands of protesters stormed president gotabaya rajapatsa's official residence some even went for a swim in his pool napped on his bed and worked out in his gym president gotabaya has resigned and fled the country [Music] this has happened again economy that had been spiraling out of control leaving citizens unable to afford fuel medicines milk powder or even toilet paper Sri Lanka has now collected over 50 billion dollars in foreign debt and owes 78 million dollars in interest alone for the first time in its history the nation has defaulted on its debt payments protesters blame the current economic crisis on just one family for the past 20 years the rajapoxas have been in power they've been accused of financial mismanagement at best and stealing millions of public funds at worst but here's the kicker none of the top dogs in the rajapoxa clan have ever been convicted of any crime this is a story of how one family allegedly bankrupted an entire nation and got away with it this is the big Steel [Music] the Roger boxer patriarch was D.A rajapaksa a wealthy Plantation owner who was a member of parliament from 1947 to 1965. together D.A rajapaksa and His Four sons mahinda gotabaya chamal and basil have created a political Dynasty that has lasted two decades mahinda Rose to power as a member of parliament in 1970. he was later elected as president in 2005 and as prime minister in 2006. his brothers captured important posts as well in 2010 and 2015 over 40 rajapaksa family members occupied government positions sparking concerns of nepotism but the family maintained a firm grip on Sri Lankan politics by Fanning nationalist sentiment mahinda especially positioned himself as a strong man and savior claiming that majoritarian Senegalese identity was under threat he doubled down in that message in 2009 when he had got a bio were credited for ending the Sri Lankan Civil War a conflict between Tamil Rebels and the government that began in 1983. these men we were told have been to within a few kilometers of the Tamil Tigers de facto capital of kilonochi this Victory came at a great cost according into a U.N estimate around 100 000 people were killed including forty thousand Tamil civilians despite concerns from the US and the UK of Human Rights abuses during the war the rajapaxas managed to stay in power the end of the war itself has saved the lives of so many youth whether it is in the North or the South so we have done that is it a crime in 2005 two important things happened first the Roger Parker Brothers took over Ministries that controlled over three quarters of the national budget and second corruption allegations began to melt in 2006 opposition politician Kabir Hashim accused Mahindra of diverting eight hundred twenty thousand dollars of Aid into a private account this money was supposed to help the nation rebuild after the devastating 2004 tsunami [Music] but mahinda flipped the script and took police investigators to court for damaging his reputation the Court ruled in mahinda's favor and the case was dropped the money later reappeared at the country's Central Bank but setting aside allegations of theft the Roger boxes were accused of gross Financial mismanagement too some say the family's excessive spending on government projects is one of the core reasons for Sri Lanka's current crisis when the 210 million dollar matala rajapasca International Airport opened in his hometown in 2013. mahinda thought it would be his crowning achievement but a year later it was a complete flop only earning 120 dollars for an entire month which is less than the income of a Street restaurant by 2015 it was empty defunct and partly converted into a warehouse for rice expensive white elephant projects that don't generate income have become symbolic of the rajapox's overspending where's these deals suffer from a complete lack of transparency projects in aratna a political opponent has accused Mahindra of forging illegal deals worth 5 billion dollars and critics say that may very well be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corruption among the rajapaxas the youngest brother basil the ex-finance minister was nicknamed Mr 10 for allegedly taking millions in commissions from government contracts in 2015 he was charged with stealing 530 000 from a welfare housing program but was granted bail later like his brothers gotabaya the former president has dodged his fair share of graft accusations he was under scrutiny in 2016 when an anti-bribery agency indicted him for squandering 75 million dollars of state income by allowing a private company to maintain a floating Armory he was also charged for embezzling 185 thousand dollars for the construction of a museum dedicated to his father but both cases were eventually dropped when gotabaya was defense secretary he was nicknamed The Terminator for his fiery temper and alleged murderous disposition he was accused of operating a secret death squad that covertly traveled in white Vans attacking dissidents and journalists the impunity over the years has been supervasive that it has apparently trickled down to the next generation of rajapaxas mahinda sons have both been accused of laundering millions of dollars through different businesses namal was a cabinet secretary and remains A Member of Parliament while yoshita was the chief of staff of the Prime Minister the Roger poxus have denied all of these allegations saying they're politically motivated witch hunts and international conspiracies to bring down the family but beyond corruption and power Place Sri Lanka's downfall boiled down to simple bad governance should announce sweeping tax cuts in 2019 the country's budget deficit grew to 14 of its GDP most of the revenue is being used to pay off loans so International credit rating agencies were forced to downgrade Sri Lanka even the governor of the Central Bank appealed to Citizens overseas for donations in U.S dollars Sterling or Euros to augment the nation's budget for the importation of Essentials like food and Medicine after an internal power struggle mahinda and the cabinet resigned earlier this year while gotabaya fled the country and also resigned to pacify the public earlier he also appointed political rival Runner wikimasinga as prime minister and even promised not to contest elections again but Sri Lankan say this isn't enough although wiko masinga is from an opposition party he is still considered a political Insider in Sri Lankan politics even when the rajapoxas were out of power control only shuffled between members of a rich Elite political class they're like spokes on the same wheel replacing each other after elections promising to be tough on their Rivals But ultimately continue to jump together because they all benefit from the prevailing system as of July 2022 Sri Lanka's economy is still paralyzed they're out of food Fuel and even electricity the government has raised taxes to generate Revenue forced shutdowns to save fuel and incentivized officials to take up farming in order to boost the economy but the nation needs six billion dollars to bounce back and survive the next six months glaring mismanagement by the Roger boxer family has dealt a huge blow to Sri Lanka's Economic Development but the current crisis may have spelled the end of a once powerful Dynasty and could Usher in a new era of politics in Sri Lanka [Music]", "duration(in

competition, bodybuilding posing for begginers, bodybuilding posing motivation", "script": "have you ever seen those MMA fests that do a front double bicep well I don't know why someone hasn't taught them to pose because they can do it a lot better but Jokes Aside posing is an odd form and I quote you can put all the work into your physique but if you don't know how to pose you're not going to look good so whether you're stepping on stage or simply want the best pictures for social media we're going to run through a step-by-step tutorial through the most popular poses starting off with the front double bicep you'll see a lot of guys posing like this and we can improve it a lot so with any pose you want to start from the ground up so stand shoulder width apart and flare your quads next reach up like you're doing a lat pull down this is to get the Mind muscle Connection in your back so that you can Flex it properly now bring your arms down in the same lat pull down motion and scrunch your back try imagine you're squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades now flare your lats outward this may be a challenge for you if it's your first time but it's going to take some mind muscle connection and some practice now flex your biceps by throwing your thumbs backwards this helps to display your Peak better now Al together it should look something like this here's the before and after now of of course we all have different frames and bodies with any posing you need to adapt the poses to suit your physique and for the next pose I see this butchered the most because it is a little challenging this is the side chest now there are multiple ways that you can do this pose but this is how I do it start by facing yourself parallel to the camera or audience and anger yourself ever so slightly outward I'll explain why this is important a little bit later next keep your feet like this with this section of your outer foot in your inner foot bend your knees a little and push your hamstring against your knee and you can see see this is one of the tricks that the professionals use moving to the upper body stick your arm out just like this with your other hand scoop your PEC and place it on your wrist now flex your bicep and tricep against one another and twist into position now this is where the feet position comes into play because with our feet angled outwards it makes our waist appear smaller lastly make sure your shoulder is back in order to display your chest the biggest mistake I see with this pose is that a lot of people leave negative space with their arm and of course this doesn't do your physique the justice that it should another mistake is that whisky shoulder some people tend to keep it either too far forward or too far back now again this is where you're going to have to use your own discretion and adjust it to your physique and for the next Poe the crab also known as the most muscular you can see why it's called the crab so as always starting from the ground up H your legs shoulder width apart and flare your quads or alternatively you could do the quad stomp next reach up to the ceiling and all in one motion wash the windows lean forward and flex everything that's why it's called the most muscular because you're flexing everything something a lot of people struggle with this pose is trap activation if you can't get it right what I recommend is get some dumbbells have them in front of you and shrug do it nice and slow and you're going to develop that connection biggest mistakes I see with this pose is not getting the bend right some people either lean too far forward or not enough and next is the arm position some people tend to close themselves off too much and cover their physique I mean the whole point of posing is to display your physique so give all these poses some practice let me know which you're struggling with and if there's any others you'd like to see I hope you enjoyed this I'll see you next time",

the angad family of systems so what do we know about it its name is going to be the f-47 where did that come from who the heck knows f-35's designation had already skipped a lot of numbers throwing logic out of the window and history is repeating itself curiously the current Trump's presidency is 47th in the US History anyway the contract was won by Boeing which may be due to Air Force's dissatisfaction with locked Martin all that's known about plan's appearance comes from two image renders released by The Air Force they show a plane with a very distinct Chine starting from the planes nose one of the images pretty clearly suggests canards with a high dihedral angle meaning pointing upwards the other image doesn't show those cannards though the whole image is more artistic and more of the plane is hidden in the clouds and Vapor curiously the wings seem to have the same dihedral angle that is quite unusual and likely there due to stealth reasons planes like F22 F35 and China's j20 and j36 all have a potential radar signal trap when looked from the side right where the wing meets the lower fuselage f47 seems to be avoiding that spot with a single diamondlike cross-section when looked at From Below or the sides there is of course some similarity with boing's bird of prey demonstrator aircraft that was a tiny plane which flew in the 1990s it allegedly managed such a low Rader cross-section that it could be seen by naked eye but not tracked by fighter jet radar even from just a few miles away its alleged radar cross-section value was -70 DB orders of magnitude less than f-22s - 40 DB and that was with 30-year-old stealth technology the rear half of the f47 is not visible so nothing can be really said about it but two more details are interesting one the canopy looks fairly wide compared to the rest of the plane and two the front landing gear shows a single wheel unlike for example the twin landing gear of the much bigger and heavier Chinese j36 fighter so it's seems plausible that this plane is not really some huge 50ft wingspan 70t long Behemoth it's quite plausible that it's around F22 size or even smaller sure it's theoretically possible the wide cockpit features side by-side seating but would the plane then have a single wheel front landing gear probably not for the longest time the Air Force hinted at the need for the six gen fighter possibly being quite large and heavy that seems to be the route China picked with with its j36 but since last year the Air Force also suggested a smaller F35 sized plane might also be viable this may indeed be what we are seeing now with the shown f47 renders the Air Force also released this statement by General olvin its Chief of Staff various expected superlatives are used f47 is to be the most advanced lethal and most adaptable fighter ever but some Curious details also followed it's designed to outpace outmatch and outmaneuver any adversary now outmaneuvering is strange as NextGen planes are generally not considered to put focus on maneuverability due to lack of large control surfaces but it could be that maneuverability mentioned there is more like agility that General Alvin isn't talking about turning instead he may be talking about plane's ability to rapidly change location and altitude that might be achieved by its next Generation engines combining best of Both Worlds turbo fan mode for fuel efficiency and turbo jet mode when power is needed General's statement also holds several eyebrow razors the f-47 will have significantly longer range than us fifth generation Fighters F35 holds the edge there with nearly 900 M of combat radius in an air-to-air Mission now how can a small-sized fighter jets significantly outrange that while those Advanced engines have been in development for a long time and engine makers touted at least 25% in fuel efficiency savings F35 is also an over-engineered multi-roll plane it's designed to fly for 40 years hauling bombs F 47's airframe may be designed to last just half as long indeed some years ago the Air Force was exploring successive iterative designs to quickly replace one another rather than sticking with a single design for decades and F4 7 may be designed to only hold a few amam sized air-to-air missiles if there are indeed going to be more than five drones accompanying each f47 which the Air Force strongly hinted at earlier there may not be need for more than four or so missiles as the drones would really be the missile carriers and Shooters novel construction methods using metal printing combined with all set so far might allow more room for fuel and less weight leading to not just 25 but perhaps perhaps even 50% more range over the F35 in theory the plane may have just one engine which might lead to further weight savings General Alvin also admitted multiple xplain demonstrators flew for The Last 5 Years and at f47 has unprecedented maturity so much so that the Prototype will fly during Trump's presidency meaning by 2028 at the latest that's indeed a bit quicker than F35 or F22 flu after being selected that being said several more years always elapse for testing and refinements after the first flight so first serial produced airframes may not reach the Air Force before 2032 or so with initial operational capability declared around 2035 or so that's bov's guess of course even that would be slightly quicker induction into service than the past fighter jets had furthermore the f-47 was quoted to cost less than the F22 with the Air Force having more of them in the inventory once again that points to the design not being some huge super Advanced Starship but a more manageable design perhaps in between of F35 and F22 in size only more advanced cost is a relative thing the sole fact there are to be more planes means the overall cost can be split among more airf frames to get a lower price per airframe after many produced even FlyAway cost can be kept low that's why the F35 is currently cheaper than the F-15 EX in previous years before a small scale option was muled andad was described as costing multiple hundreds of millions and that only 200 or so might be affordable so this may be another indication that we are looking at a smaller cheaper solution but with drone formations and tanker aircraft a super large air Cruiser may not be needed future will surely bring more more info on the f47 but it seems the US has been preparing itself for this for quite some time perhaps even before the alleged paus in angat program which came in the summer of 2024 Boeing has had new buildings constructed even before that and we will conclude this video with a curious thought what if the seeming inclusion of canards Boeing as the winner and the overall size all suggest that the Navy's design is going to be a variant of the Air Force one we will see but boing winning that contract too is looking rather plausible come mid 2030s us adversaries may get to see just how much of a capability leap the f-47 is and of hopes we will learn about the plane more even sooner so we can do a comparison video with the Chinese six gen Fighters", "duration(in seconds)": 524.0,

Forces system sir so we have the French we have the Russian we have Indian but we do not have American I'm thinking of a solution sir Because by the time this amka thing comes up and you yourself said that those timelines that they've given are very ambitious we are sitting at 2024 which means that by the end almost of 2040 we will have our first gener first Squadron of our fifth generation they see locally manufactured fifth generation fighter yeah where do we go for 15 years we will live blank in front of China you have brought in a very valid point so let's talk about first uh F35 you mentioned this thing you know AO India last AO India a lot of speculation started F35 has been shown in the AO India so speculation started in the media is India interested in buying it okay so I wrote a piece on uh that uh that time so my uh views are that two of three points regarding that first is affordability that aircraft is cost wise can we afforded number one second is which I have already mentioned America never gives you the latest they will hold back the thing third is even if we go in for it time frames which you're talking about you know the F35 the committed liability I won't call it liability the commitments already which are there are turn with will come much later okay they already committed to all the NATO and GRE gave a very big order sir very I think two two three Squad they're not going to make it for us in Prior on priority yes sir so we our orders will be much delayed so keeping and plus fourth is diversity which we have already fifth is in even F35 there are a lot of components and a lot of uh this thing which are you know intricate and Supply chains are with all other partners okay it's not only pure American and American company and all so keeping all these factors in mind uh F35 is not a solution at the moment I mean both ways from American side as well as our site and even if you go in for it it is not that overnight it'll come they'll Americans are not going to deliver you whatever they have straight away and fly you into fly even if it you pushed against the wall that they will send you so many aircraft overnight I don't think that will happen let's say in 5 years yeah so know 5 years is also very very optimistic in my uh assessment so at the moment I'm sorry to interrupt you sir my apologies what I wanted to ask you're saying five years is very optimistic so you're saying that uh Jo F35 platform let us say India writes a big check forget about the cost for a moment let's say that cost doesn't matter we need it for our national security and we butter versus bullets like you said we we we bite the bullet and we say we want five squadrons of F35 man yeah I'm a five squ she you're saying that the first Sant even if us agrees assuming hypothetically us says we not transferring technology we'll just give it to you saying even that will come after maybe 5 7 8 9 years maybe yeah if it comes nothing like it if we come to an agreement and they say okay whatever we have you take these and fly and it'll be really welcome yeah it will be good this thing that is it's a good platform it is a good platform I mean it's a lat technology latest and best technology at the moment in the world as I said Americans always dominate the skies with the technology and it's got the latest Technologies at the moment so it'll be really welcome yeah if it happens or nothing like that but I'm being practical that's what I'm trying you're being practical so practically speaking you said you're saying it makes sense to buy moreels yeah while supporting that and maintaining improving on your ecosystem of Defense industry if you're talking about being manufactured in India to there was an interview of the doal aviation CEO where he said that given enough numbers we are happy to manufactur in India yeah given enough numbers how many Rafel squin do we need sir because currently some squin are being phased out also sir yeah so so we Face a issue so you know Air Force capability development you know we always there two plans one is you mentioned earlier once you know fight with whatever we have and second is the long-term I feel very sad when I hear this sir yeah yeah I know I know it is a very sad statement start in fact the air Chief Sir he mentioned very recently uh but I think we should be more the government sir we should be most supportive of the Air Force started with the Army Chief General Malik sir saying that we fight with what because it's unfortunate s we should support So this uh mitigation plan is called Draw down mitigation plan yes sir draw down means the draw down has already occurred we are less than whatever thing and mitigation is you know mitigating plan is revised unfortunately the timelines keep slipping due to uh various factors you know cost in terms of Supply in terms of uh def atbara support so these Dynamics play into come into the play so uh I keep jokingly saying if you don't make the Lea frog work a time will come when you'll have to do a pole VA I hope it doesn't and that PO World situation which you mentioned of Americans sending us the f f35s I that would be a poal situation maybe situation I hope we don't come to that uh so so how many ref Squad sir yeah so as I said 114 at least the pro which is going on we should go for that and commit okay in case they want long-term commitment and but in a phc manner as I said due to lot of advant what of advantages I mentioned earlier okay that's what we should do see other thing what you talking about you know France telling you this thing and all uh and now also in the contract lot of uh media it comes out the technology of to technology become a buzz word yeah yes sir to is agreed in to but how much of to is agreed yeah that's what you need to look into it not only content you know it talks about percentage Yeah 50% 60% that's fine yeah what out of that is critical yeah now if you can't have a engine what do you do with that platform and avionics and weapons so what you're saying is that even somebody says 90% to yeah it's not good enough it's not good enough unless it's 100% because that what is that 10% sir that if it is very critical what do you doy and most difficult is the you know Blades of turbine and two things one is they operating at very very high temperature secondly the uh very high RPMs those are stress level on those is very high now that is the critical technology of a engine fighter engine now nobody wants to part with it yeah there only few countri and few companies who are into it if they part with it they're losing their revenue yeah they're losing their core competency now if they part with it they are going to draw the pound of Flesh why do you think Safran I mean although I don't want to mention we've been talking about you know this engine technology transfer and uh this thing full technology transfers for so long uh it's not working out because of monetary issues I mean we can't uh spend so much money on that which they asking if there's a V media okay fine if it comes through it is good why is the project I mean the deal not coming through these engines because one is that they don't want to part and secondly if they want to part then they have to draw out the cost out of it which is fair sir which is fair enough if we want we should be willing to pay yeah very true unfortunately our CI project didn't work the way it should have been working and now they're saying okay whatever project is closed but uh based on the what we'll start a new this thing and maybe will fly with our indigenous engine I hope so uh because that is once required and this uh incident of delay in supply of 414 engines from us they given us a jka in the sense ke without the engine now what do you do here your whole project is delayed now and it's being delayed for almost a year now and tomorrow in the war time when you want to boost up your production cap production capability is another issue we talked about ecosystem now eight aircraft a year is not good enough yeah you know 16 aircraft 24 aircraft we need to get into all that to at least one squad for per year per year minimum yeah that is a whole dynamics of it is a quite an intricate subject uh and uh Lots needs to be done on it thank you so very much for talking to us", "duration(in seconds)": 534.0, "region": "US"}}

From the state of the stock market to major companies rolling back Dei policies. There's so much going on in our next guest says concerns loom for business leaders because many fear losing access, influence and potentially attracting retribution. I want to talk about all of these things, to discuss everything that's going on in our economy, what it means to be a CEO today. Former Blackstone president CEO Tony James. Also, we should mention the chairman of retailer Costco, and we can get a pulse on what's going on with the state of the consumer as well. Good morning to you. Good morning Andrew okay. So I'm I'm just curious your sort of sense of confidence in today's economy relative to what we're seeing in the stock market. What is what's your sort of gut on what's happening here? >> I think the economy is weakening. It didn't. >> Have a lot. >> Of. >> Momentum, but it was okay. But it's definitely starting. >> To turn down. >> I think the consumer there's several warning signs. Confidence was down. Obviously the base. >> Of consumers. >> That are driving spending is narrowed to affluent defaults. Delinquencies are rising. Meme stocks are down. There's a lot of things to say. The consumer is starting to buckle a little bit. At the same time, I think the uncertainty coming out of Washington is causing businesses to slow down. What's my supply chain going to cost? I don't know, can I export? Are they going to be reciprocal duties? I don't know, should I. >> Build another plant? >> Let's wait and see. >> Okay. So just help me with this because there feels like there's a disconnect. We've had so many business leaders come on our air. I would say over the last 2 or 3 months and say, oh my goodness, we're going to become unshackled by regulations that are just going to disappear. We are excited about, you know, taxes, all sorts of things. Right? I mean, you've heard that over and over again. So explain that with the perspective that you're offering right now. >> Well. >> There's certainly been an. >> Ambulance about my Republican friends who are business leaders. I agree, one of the greatest errors of American history is going to unleash the deals business and so on and so forth. I don't see it happening. I mean. >> On the. >> Ground. I actually think we are slowing. >> And for all the. >> Reasons I mentioned, I think business leaders are very reluctant to stick their head up right now and start start complaining. >> Hey, Tony, just what we've heard over the last week from a lot of the retailers that have been reporting their earnings, is that they're cautious about this next year that's coming up. But the results they saw in December and even in January have been stronger than they had anticipated. The consumers have been doing better. What do you see? Maybe through Costco, maybe through other places, that makes you think that the consumer is actually already starting to turn down? >> I don't think I see it at Costco, honestly, but I'd say they generally target a. >> More affluent consumer. >> The average Costco consumer has about two times the national median average of wages, and those results are holding up. Are they exceeding expectations like you said, Becky? No. >> But they're. >> Holding Home Depot and Lowe's in the last two days, have both said that they've exceeded their own expectations on some of these things. And January was pretty strong for Walmart. >> January was butt. Walmart also blew a caution whistle on the future. >> Yeah. >> I'd say Costco is hanging in there, but that's not where we that's not where we where we see the slowdown. It's in confidence. Ironically, something like as simple as egg prices seem to have a lot of correlation with the economy and consumer attitudes. And obviously, you know where those are going. >> Well, that's we know why they're there. It's a total one off. But do you think that we were overregulated the economy in business during the Biden administration? You think only Republican business people are optimistic about a more friendly regulatory environment for business? You don't think there's anything to that? >> No. I totally agree with you. I think all business executives felt we were overregulated, honestly. And I think there's both Republicans and Democrats. There's a lot of good things that they like about the directions that President Trump is going, okay. However, there's also a lot of uncertainty, tariffs and a lot of variability. And it's very hard if you're a business to plan. Right now, we own a fertilizer company that's that sells a lot into Canada. We were going to build a new plant. Now we're holding off. We don't if there's duties on Canada and the reciprocal duties coming back, we don't know what that does to us. Similarly, a lot of our companies, the supply chains are completely up in the air. What's what's the cost of goods and how. >> That's all tariff related is where a lot of these. >> Related some of that we have we have plenty of health care companies that are looking at much lower regulatory approvals with Doge and everything. So if you had if you're a if you're a biotech company and you had one year's worth of runway in your cash, now maybe you have to slow things down, stretch it out. So you have two years. >> They already are assuming that cuts at the FDA are going to make. >> We have. >> To put advisory panels, or they. >> Have to assume that because running out of money is death. >> The cuts. Have there been cuts already at the FDA that would cause clinical trials to be delayed? >> Not I don't. >> Know, actually, but that's not really the concern. No one's going to count the cuts. It's the chaos down there. It's the it's the reduced. >> You see any positives to trying to rein in government waste? >> 100%. >> You do. >> Every one of the last fiv presidents. Both parties have said government is too big. I'll cut it back. And they failed. And I think this is a lot like Elon's approach to say, Tesla cut maybe over cut, cut radically. And then if you cut too much, you can add it back. And that's the only way you make significant cost. >> And so do you think he's right about that. And I ask because the other thing is he said, and I don't know whether voters listen to this or not. He explicitly said before the election that there was going to be pain. There was going to be now. He suggested it was a temporary pain because he thinks it on the other side. It's going to be better. But the question is whether, you know, we are going to, quote unquote, suffer for six months or a year and that there's, you know, a rainbow on the other side. >> Well, there's a lot of stuff thrown in here together. So let's just separate it out a little bit. There's certainly the business community is certainly, I think, 100% for less regulation. It's less government waste. Tariffs. If tariffs can have a very good effect, if they're used as a bargaining chip to get other deals, and if they're used to lower barriers from other countries, if it triggers a trade war, that's a different thing. So the tariffs is a little hard to know which way it goes. Is it beneficial? Is it not. However, all those things, if your business executive right now, you don't know the path of the future. So that causes you to hold back on things temporarily. So I threw the business in there. I think the consumer is suffering. Confidence is coming down, but business is not providing", "duration(in seconds)": 424.0, "region": "US"}}

Capital and American capital? Those connections. Are breaking down. So that's the essence of. >> The backdrop. >> When we get into the tariffs, I'm. >> Sure we'll get into it. >> But that's. A great. >> That's a great backdrop to understand the way you're thinking about it contextually. But let's get let's go straight to the tariffs, which is to say how do you think. Therefore they play out. Is there you know, given the history that you talk about, is there the political appeal either here in the US or elsewhere for these tariffs ultimately. And from an economic perspective, as we're all watching the market today, it's gotten a little bit better. But obviously, you know, folks have lost 10%. You know, someone someone said to me last week it's like a wealth tax except that nobody gets the money. In that, you know, 10% of a lot of folks wealth vanished overnight as a function of at least this discussion thus far. So what happens? >> Well, mechanistically. >> It raises costs. >> It lowers. >> Revenues for companies. >> I mean, what does it mean for. >> A company? It means. >> Costs are going to go up. >> Revenue is going to go down. >> And capital. >> Is going. >> To be harder. >> To. >> Come by. And so. >> And then. We're trying. >> To replace manufacturing. >> I mean I agree with the problems okay. >> About the fact. >> That we don't. >> Manufacture and. >> That. >> There is. >> A problem with that. >> But there's. >> A structural. >> Problem of whether we can manufacture. We have a population that basically. >> 3 million. >> People. 1% of the population is incredibly brilliant. I mean, they go to the best. >> Schools. >> They. >> Come out, they make the unicorn's. >> Inventiveness, half. >> Of which, by. >> The way, are foreigners. >> And at the same time, they. >> Are making. >> The unicorns. At the same time, what we have is. 10% of the population around them. >> That's doing very well. >> The 60%. >> Of the population. >> Has below a sixth grade reading level. And they're it's. >> Tough to be productive. So when we agree with. >> The. >> Problem, too much debt. >> Secretary Bennett's. Visit and others agree we should get it down to 3%. We have to get the budget deficits down to 3% of GDP. >> This is not. >> We all. >> Agree on the problem. >> The question. >> Is when? What do we do about it? >> How do you create that self-sufficiency? And so from a. Practical point of view, that manufacturing. Is very. Difficult under this. >> Set of. >> Circumstances to. Create within the United States, yet. >> It's needed. >> So therefore, you agree with the president. You disagree with the president. I'm trying to understand what what what the conclusion is here. If the president is watching you right now, Scott Besson is watching you right now. You're telling him what? This is a good idea. You're telling him, abandon this idea. What are. >> You saying? >> I. I agree with. >> The problem. >> Okay. >> I am. >> Very concerned. >> About the solution. Okay. The practicality of the solution. In other words, I think. That this. >> Is going to create. >> Not only the problem, the capital markets problem that I'm talking about related to. >> Prices going up, costs going. >> Up, costs going up, prices. >> Revenue going down. >> And. >> Capital problem. But I also think that this is going. To create great sand in the gears of. >> Production worldwide. >> At the same time, I do agree that this interdependency, this issue of productivity in the world in which we have to be competitive and productive and we're not. >> Competitive in. >> Using things, is a longer term problem, not. >> An easy one. >> And I do expect. >> That it is going. >> To have. Political consequences. This is. The nature of. The cycle. It is coming also at the same time. >> As we have a budget issue. >> Now the budget issue is. Is a comparably important issue. So as we look. Ahead in the months ahead, we have to get the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP. I worry about that at the same time as this is happening. These are not. Easy problems to solve. I'm concerned because. >> The bigger. >> Problems exist. The debt exists. >> You can't get around. >> The debt. The overspending exists.

this is amazing the Rayband metag glasses have been around for a few months I've got a pair for the sun here they also come with clear lenses their main aim being to create content so you've got

coming soon and they're all based around AI first off it's time to translate a book from Spanish to English hey meta translate this book no joy at first I wonder if it's cuz I keep looking at the camera let's try again hey meta translate this book it thinks it's a blank book holding it up in front of my face might just do it hey meta translate this book for a moment the cameras are stuck on Peter's downturn gaze while everyone assimilates what he just said it's reading it like an audio book may have been a glitch start but this is great you can also just keep the AI function on for half an hour and do all sorts of things hey meta tell me what's in front of me in front of me is a person that he has been filming two chairs some things on the table including some promotional material which is a CES magazine that was seriously impressive and the sound quality was absolutely amazing to there are 3 to four hours battery life available on them but the case also charges them it can give you an extra three charges throughout the day holiday's glasses have a different Focus I've actually got a screen in my field of view over there which allows me to read words so it can translate it can help me answer questions if I'm having a conversation to make me sound really clever because it connects via your phone to the internet to what function you're using you can either swipe the side or through this ring there's a little touch pad on the back and so you can scroll up and down now I'm going to put it to the test with a spot of translation you're going to speak in Mandarin and I'm hopefully going to see the words come up here in English it seems to be a bit behind and the screen keeps going off I'm talking to you in Chinese right now can you hear what I'm saying I can not only hear it I can understand it how's the battery life the battery life lasts longer than 12 hours so use it for entire day that would be a very long conversation there were some challenges with internet connection and noise on the show floor but even when the projected screen worked well it never really felt comfortable to look at a proof of concept yes but a perfected experience not quite now most glasses are meant to Aid your eyes but how about your ears there many people who could benefit from wearing a hearing aid but they don't sometimes because they simply don't want it to show so how about an invisible solution that could be combined with a pair of glasses these are the Nuance audio smart glasses which also have speakers on the side but this time to amplify all the sound around or boost people's voices the accompanying smartphone app allows you to choose the right settings for your environment let me demonstrate what did you have for breakfast this morning I've got some EG and a ccinos now that sounded louder to me whilst the background noise didn't and that's because they're a directional microphone so whatever I'm looking at is what I'm going to hear louder now the sound quality is really clear it can be a little bit tinny but we are in quite a difficult environment here in the middle of the show floor the fact is they do isolate the voice they do make it louder and they do what they say on the tin smart glasses can clearly provide an array of benefits perhaps some you never even knew you wanted how are those glasses are all about color change so this pair can be worn with lenses or you can have a sunglass version and by just tapping the side you change the color of the glass pink blue orange clear so whatever the weather conditions are or whatever you're getting up to you can make it appropriate if you want something sportier though then this these are audio sunglasses you can listen to music in them you can also make phone calls there's a microphone and speakers here just above the ears and you can adjust the brightness so if you're in bright light you move it like this and the lenses become darker when things get a little bit darker well there you go you can see better as the early days of tech trends go some of them seem impressively up to the job already whilst others feel like an early generation of an idea a to be built upon", "duration(in seconds)": 354.0, "region": "US"}}

Educational | Kid Crew", "niche": "space travel , planets , rockets", "description": "In this video we pretend to be an astronaut and head to space in our ride on kids rocket ship to prepare for the solar eclipse! We're putting down the power wheels for the day to fly high in our solar system. We also play with our Lego space toys inside! \n\nFirst, we arrive at the space shuttle launch pad and receive our mission. Launch a satellite to study space before the total solar eclipse. We open the rocket's canopy and buckle up. We raise the launch platform and grab the joysticks as the launch sequence initiates. 3 2 1 liftoff! The ride on rocket ship blasts into the sky and soon we are in space. This is way faster than any of our trucks. We open the cargo bay doors and deploy the satellite just in time for the eclipse. Then we head to Mars in our rocket ship to pick up some space garbage. We make a smooth landing and then collect the trash. We hop back in our rocket after walking on the martian surface and head back to earth. Its a successful mission! After cleaning up that mess, we head inside to play with our Lego space toy sets. First an out of control satellite collides with a space shuttle and then crashes on the moon. The space shuttle is OK, and calls mission control for help. A rocket is deployed and goes to the moon to collect the satellite with the help of a rover team. They find the wreckage and head back to earth. They splash down in the bath tub where a boat is ready to retrieve them.  In the educational segment we learn how a solar eclipse works with a moving diorama in the back yard. Remember, don't look at an eclipse without approved eclipse glasses. \n\nCome pretend play with us! Join us kids, toddlers, girls, and boys as we use our ride on toy trucks, toy tractors, and toy equipment to do construction, farming, and home improvement pretend play projects. While we play our games and drive our vehicles, we learn about engineering, science, STEM, and how things work in our educational segment.

greatest featherweight of all time was in question but man just add a massive capstone moment to his legacy if he retired tomorrow or loses that thing outright next time he fights there will still be that incredible win over Lopez last night to recapture the title after that devastating run that marked the demise of his initial title reign that is forever now it's MMA cannon and one of the best highlights of Alex's career i would put that equal to if not on a higher level than Randy Couture coming out of retirement to beat Tim Sylvia even though he was I believe 87 years old on the night i know that is a very bold statement but Randy had been defying age and odds most of his career and no offense to Tim Sylvia but it felt like oh the reasonQur was able to almost identically to Vulk show up a year after losing a title fight only to again capture gold in glorious fashion is because the heavyweight division was in shambles and Sylvia was at the top of it but I digress vulcganowski came into that fight last night at 36 years old he was the poster child for age catching up with you as a fighter in fact the two videos we've done recently about aging in the UFC have featured Vulk in the thumbnail it's such a cliche now but it's a cliche because it's largely true father Time is undefeated nobody has two primes except for George Foreman all that stuff and I'm not saying this is going to lay the groundwork for another long and prosperous title reign for Alexander the Great but who knows the guy is incredible and he certainly seemed ambitious in his hopes to go back to being a fighting champion so I suppose we shall see how long that can hold up but again this isn't about the future this is about last night to come in after the losses he'd faced backto back that short notice devastating headkick KO by Islam the second round knockout by Ilia to lose his featherweight title and then to have sat on those losses for over a year to have every single pundant and fan point out that at Vulk's age statistically it's incredibly unlikely he's ever going to hold gold again and then to carry all of that out there against an absolute animal in Diego Lopez just about as good a representative of the new guard as you could get and still put on the performance he did through five rounds despite getting knocked down despite getting some bad cuts despite getting some serious pressure from Lopez that was a hard fight and Vulk could have easily crumbled under the pressure under the weight of everything he brought into the cage but he still went out there and he fought like it was 2021 again that is the stuff of legends i couldn't be happier for Vulk even though it wasn't reclaiming his gold from Taporia it really was probably the next best thing but truly that fight wasn't about the opponent diego was an element of the story but that was Vulk versus Vulk vulk versus time and he beat everybody's ass last night and as for what's next I mean I guess we'll see air seemed pretty adamant that he'd be getting a title shot off that win over Patriceio Pitbull and maybe that is in the works personally I don't want to see that rematch just yet but the suggestion that Rogan had Lord Silva and El Pantara throwing down to see who fights Vulk next man sign me up for that one we can let Alex rest for a bit there's no rush right now in that division now as awesome as Vulk's win was a story that was absolutely worthy of the top of the video and its title and thumbnail we got to talk about Patty the BD and that is truly the first time I personally have ever felt that way i know oftentimes fans have strong reactions to how we at OnPoint feel about Pimpblelett however you think it is we feel about him but full disclosure he's never been for me personally one that I felt I needed to think of as a potential mainenter i just wasn't into it until last night it was truly the perfect win patty came out there with the typical swagger the intangible stuff that sells tickets but we've seen that plenty that was never in question it was whether or not he's an elite fighter and I think he earned the right to get a chance to prove that and as someone who has looked at Patty's previous wins and said \"Well who were any of those early guys he fought?\" The judges absolutely gifted him the Jared Gordon win tony Ferguson was in no place to be considered a test for anybody as much as I hate to say that and again with all due respect to King Green these were just not elite fights they weren't and so the non-believer in me going into this week already had caveats in my head and it's hard to say but Michael Chandler hasn't exactly had the best run in the UFC so if Patty narrowly defeated him or Chandler did something really overly aggressive and got himself caught I was fully ready to say well still not much of a test but that's not at all how I feel in fact I think given the trouble that Chandler has had at the top of the UFC if you're going to be a title contender that is exactly the kind of victory you should be having over Mike he kicked the [ __ ] out of him that was the best that Patty has ever looked in the octagon and now I'm fully intrigued to see him in a title eliminator against somebody in that top five the performance has finally caught up with the swagger and the annoying fans with the wigs and all that stuff if somebody like me who never really found much interest in him is excited for his next fight for the first time that fight is going to be huge and special especially if he can perform like that again we've seen this story play out a bunch of times and it's really simple if your hype was massive coming in like Patty's was there's got to be that moment that you prove your hype that you finally get skeptical fans on board and Pimpblelet just had that all right so Patty and Vulk were the two big narratives coming out of 314 but it wasn't the only thing that happened in a hot night in Miami so let's look at the numbers this thing produced and pass out some awards to wrap this thing up the UFC's fourth ever trip to Vice City saw 13 fights with six KO TKOs's two submissions five decisions for a total cage time of 2 hours 22 minutes 47 seconds it was almost all favorites 11 earned wins by the end of the evening with dogs defying the odds just two times a big time bet for you would have been choosing Lord Silva taking out Bryce Mitchell via submission in the second round because it was a plus 2800 outcome massive payout there when Dominic Reyes wins a fight it's by knockout at least that has been the trend going all the way back to 2019 dom's four victories in that time including the one last night and the three he's had backto back are all KO TKOs's that is five in a row for Lord Silva in the UFC with five finishes going back to his debut early last year what a [ __ ] nerd give that man our near future main event award that was Pit Bull's first decision loss in a three- round fight since 2010 the guy who beat him tonight Yaier Rodriguez was 17 years old at the time speaking of that's El Pantara's first victory in over 2 years also dude was jacked out of his mind no stat there just shredded like a Julianne salad that was the seventh straight win for Patty the Batty in the UFC and the biggest by a huge margin that gives Pimpblelet the second longest win streak in the lightweight division behind none other than champion Islam dude is one away from a title shot he called the crowd a bunch of mushrooms what a night for Liverpool michael Chandler is now officially two and five in the UFC his only victories Dan Hooker and Tony Ferguson and finally in our main event that was the biggest strike differential ever scored against Diego Lopez that was Alex's 10th title fight in a row going back to 2019 hard to fall off when you're at the very top and as they mentioned on the broadcast Vulk became the first fighter over 35 under 155 to ever win a world title earning him our get [ __ ] father time award my kids these days no respect and that is 314 all done and dusted i cannot thank Max Randall enough for his legendary run on these autopsies gets them done faster

projects air power in West Asia it is also preparing for future conflicts and leading the charge is of course Donald Trump the president wants a new toy for his Air Force a shiny costly stealthy brand new fighter jet Trump unveiled his plans over the weekend and awarded the contract to boing boing will now make America's Next Cutting Edge jet it will be designated the f47 where the F stands for fighter and 47 is for the 47th president of the United States which happens to be Donald Trump you just can't miss the coincidence the aircraft will be made under a program called the ngad stands for Next Generation air dominance fighter ngad it will give the US Air Force its first sixth generation stealth fighter jet Donald Trump believes it will change air combat forever and give America the edge in the battlefield here's what he said the f47 will be the most advanced most capable most lethal aircraft ever built an experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost 5 Years and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other Nation there's no other Nation we know every other plane I've seen every one of them and it's not even close this is a next level Trump said the aircraft has been flying for five years so why is it being unveiled now you see the ngad program was approved in 2014 but the Biden Administration put a halt on the project and the reason was quite simple the Sixth Gen stealth jet will burn holes in America's Pockets boing needs $20 billion just to Kickstart the work and look at the cost of each aircraft upwards of $300 million let me spell that out for you again $300 million for one single jet that's more than the GDP of some countries making it the costliest weapon ever as of today the americanmade F35 stealth jet holds that title the costliest one aircraft costs about $80 million but each f47 would cost more than three times more and yet not much is known about it initial design show the aircraft with large Wings a tailess body adding to its stealth and kards for agility the US Air Force plans to induct the f47 in five years and boing secretive team called Phantom Works will manufacture the aircraft for Trump this is all good Optics a new fighter jet under his presidency sits well for his America first image and secondly Trump has given boing its biggest Lifeline yet you see boing has been on a downward spiral we've been telling you about this this passenger plane crashes faulty paths quality control issues and delayed deliveries of the presidential jet the Air Force One these are just some of the issues plaguing boing apart from losing public Trust of course the Aerospace firm has lost its biggest customer the US military until Trump 2.0 happened now the contract has gone to boing ending the reign of its main competitor loed Martin until now loed Martin was a sole contractor for making stealth fighter jets in the west it was a monopoly in 2005 it gave America the F22 Raptor and 10 years later it rolled out the F35 lightning this jet is now operated across NATO it was made by loed Martin but this time boing trumped loed Martin and the reaction was quick loed Martin's stock plunged by more than 5% and Boeing stocks gained by more than 3% the markets are showing trust in Boeing at least for now but can it deliver it doesn't have the luxury of time the f47 is supposed to replace the F22 the F22 is America's best fighter jet it is more than two decades old now the US is the only country that still operates the F-22 there are almost 190 aircraft in service so boing has to bring in the new jet soon because geopolitics is changing fast and Trump believes the threat from China is growing with the West busy with the war in Ukraine Beijing has been on a modernizing spree in December last year China unveiled not one but two tailess stealth Jets two Jets the j36 and the j50 China claims they are sixth generation aircraft but China is also known for its exaggerated PR so its claim remains questionable nonetheless Washington is feeling the Heat and the air for 7 is Trump's answer to China of course the big question is can he pull it off he wants the jet to enter service before he leaves the White House he's worried that the next Administration could slam the brakes because of the cost like I said each jet costs more than $300 million that's a lot of money on the other hand China has unveiled two sixth generation prototypes it's now a Scramble for the skies Which side will blink first will the f47 retain America's dominance as a threat from China grows and most importantly can boing even pull this off we'll be tracking greeting you with Aloha and Namaste now I I I love India presents uh occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India what we saw in Kashmir and the Prime Minister how do you see Trump's America yes the current Administration behaves differently from the previous [Music] administration are you saying that there are foreign powers who are trying to bring down the current government in Syria exactly Iran maybe [Music] Russia Prime Minister Modi committed to our South South you know

At times running up to six times target, the banks blamed the Ukraine war, but critics point to the rapid rise in inflation before war broke out, and amongst other factors often find quantitative easing at fault. Moreover, some claim there is a more fundamental problem that there is no overall coherent economic theory in the first place. Bank models failed to predict the 2008 crash or the more recent cost of living crisis. In 2015, the European Central Bank claimed that neither monetarist nor Keynesian economics provided solutions to the financial crisis, leading some to question if any economic theory had the answers.\n\nShould we conclude that central bank failures to predict, let alone avoid, economic crises are evidence of a deep underlying flaw in their understanding? Or were banks just negligent in their failure to respond to evidence of rising inflation? Do we need a radical new economic theory or should we conclude that the economy is not predictable, forecasting a mugs game, and the options for government policy wider than commonly supposed?\n\n#economics  #financialcrisis  #YanisVaroufakis\n\nJoin Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, John Redwood Conservative MP, and Vicky Pryce, chief economics adviser to the Centre of Economics and Business Research.

Ages a provider of excuses for the powerful to do as they like does an overall coherent economic theory exist and if not is it possible to ever have one yeah you see Roger models are mathematical systems of equations that can only predict anything if solved but to be solved the models need to assume that which they need to demonstrate and that is a tendency of the capitalist economy to some equilibrium dynamic equilibrium but equilibrium nevertheless and there's the rub because capitalism from where I'm standing is a system that is spent permanently in this equilibrium and therefore predictive failures are hardwired into every economic or central bank model and I think that was a deeper meaning behind the quip by John Kenneth Galbra that econometrics was devised as if to make astrologists look good now that doesn't mean we don't need economic theory what it does mean is that we need economic theorists with a rare combination of gifts as outlined by Kanes remember what he said that the good economic policy expert economist must be simultaneously mathematician historian philosopher and policy maker they must contemplate the particular in terms of the general and be able to touch abstract and concrete ideas in the same flight of fancy of thought that they must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future uh that they must be purposeful and disinterested and they must be as aloof as artists and as grounded as um policy makers to sum up in order to be socially useful socially useful economic polic policy makers must know not only how to set aside mathematical economic models at critical moments of decision-m but more importantly how to be as Kane said disinterested how to be in other words independent of vested interest not of government but of vested interests for instance the financiers who after 2008 bullied bullied policy makers into adopting a cynical combination of harsh austerity for the vast majority out there and essentially socialist money printing for themselves that was a moment in history that exposed the role of economics today as not particularly different to that of the Bible in the Middle Ages a provider of excuses for the powerful to do as they like okay Janice thank you very much let's move on to the main theme of the debates and the questions we're breaking down the big question into into three smaller ones and the first line is should we conclude that central bank failures to predict let alone avoid economic crisis or evidence of a deep underlying flaw in their understanding i will come back to you on that Yiannis because I think that follows quite neatly from what you were saying there and then we'll take the question on further but Yiannis give me your thoughts on that well clearly the understanding of most of us is flawed there's no doubt about that but the main problem if you let let's really focus on on on the real issue the real issue is that before 2008 central bankers completely missed the asset price inflation which was being created by a tsunami of private debt and they focused only on price inflation not asset price inflation h in the meantime what was happening under the surface was this explosion of money printing by the private sector by Wall Street through structured derivatives and so on and that brought about the complete collapse the catastrophe of 2008 and then then at that moment the tragedy of the central banker begins because our states our governments failed in their task to design political economic measures through the legislature through our parliaments our parliaments had to step in and to take upon themselves the task of refloating the real economy a real investment instead of that what they did was they let the bankers save the financial sector by printing tsunamis of money so you had huge liquidity the largest liquidity in the history of capitalism while everybody else the politicians let the ball drop they practice austerity austerity destroyed aggregate demand destroyed investment so you had this immense inongruity the greatest supply of money liquidity printed by the central banks the lowest level of demand for investment because of the austerity that was practiced in Europe and in the United States essentially right now what happens when supply is permanently above demand the price of this thing goes down what's this thing money what is the price of this thing it's the real interest rate so you can't blame them for very low interest rates because they were left to their own devices because the we politicians and I put myself in this category uh we dropped the ball are there theories are there ideas economic theories that we should grab more with both hands or should we just conclude um perhaps far more radical alternatives are necessary well what I tell my students at the university is that uh uh they have a duty study every single economic theory ever come out understand their flaws intimately and then when it comes to actually passing judgment forget all of them and just retain all the sharpness of the mind that uh this study of eclectic study of different theories what I am utterly against I actually think that the clear and present danger for our social economies are economic models i am a ma I'm a mathematician i have a PhD in economic modeling i love doing but it's a bit like chess if you had a general a general an army general trying to advinvince from chess the right strategy for fighting a real war out there that general would be dangerous similarly an economist who takes a model and tries to advince from it the right monetary or fiscal or investment policy is a clear and present danger to the rest of society uh regarding uh price controls look it depends on your understanding of the way markets work if you think that they are approaching something like perfect competition then of course there should be no price controls because the moment you pro you know you distort the market but when you see that in the middle of an energy crisis energy companies like ETF make a mint they have huge profits margins that are increasing during the energy it's clearly a distorted market already and you know when you have idea of taking money profits effectively rents out of the British economy and being a state-owned French company use it to subsidize French workers French uh customers then surely you should place slap a huge price control on them and any anything else is simply being uh you know uh complicit in what is a major distortion um on the question of central bank independence look central banks are not independent of anything maybe they're independent of the government but they are certainly not independent the European Central Bank is the most heavily politically dependent bank in the history of the world because you know nothing they can do nothing without the the um the green light from the Euro group which is unelected cabal of finance ministers could even tell their parliaments what they have ordered the European Central Bank to do to think of that as an independent central it's independent of democracy it's independent of the demos but so is the bank of England in a way right and and I you know I think we should very seriously consider different ways of appointing um the the boards of directors of central banks so so that's interesting y what you're saying is it's the personnel who are there and the way that they are selected that's the problem fundamentally I think so and who are they answering to imag you know I'm I'm I'm Athenian right so I have a very deepseated belief in jurism from the ancient Athenian experiment with judges so imagine if you had if you had through so um you know a a kind of um of board uh that that can be selected randomly but from a pool of people who have expertise and represent different parts of of of society uh from you know businesses um um trade unions um municipalities and so on and they are the ones to which the central bank directors are answerable to and to whom they have to uh to explain what they've done all right well Vicki is the deos the answer to continue

account and I know what you're saying I've missed the hype train it has been going downhill since the Takeover by Elon Musk I know there's Alternatives like blue sky like Macedon that are becoming super popular but I wanted a place where I can you know get more software engineering news like upto-date live news and Twitter is still the biggest platform for this kind of information besides like YouTube and on Twitter there's a feature called communities which is similar to Facebook groups if you ever remember those and communities are essentially groups of people focused on one topic so I joined some that are about software engineering some about C programming some about Java they have strict rules on what tweets you can make and not make inside of those communities but essentially they're focused on just like this one topic and I kept all of mine towards software engineering and my entire feed was software Engineers but one Trend I noticed going crazy was Vibe coding and if you don't know what that is don't worry I'm going to explain it to you but to do that let me show you one of the most popular things I saw on my feed looking at this PL game you might be wondering is this a new game created by a Indie Dev trying his feet in the water trying to create a new project trying to learn or is it a new student maybe someone on the younger side trying to become a Game Dev themselves but not exactly this is a project made by a prolific Vibe coder made in a matter of hours for the sole reason of making a profit when starting up the game you're instantly presented with an option to purchase an F16 for this game for $29.99 that's more than some games cost some full Triple G A games on sale so this brings me back to the main question what is Vibe coding it's the process of using AI to generate a project as quickly as possible with the least amount of effort on your end to then quickly turn it around and make a profit and I know some Vibe coders actually do this to solve their own problems and not push a profit however there's a large vocal group that that's their only goal like this Vibe coder flexing on all of us peasants from first class while making a project using Claude turns out it was a calorie tracking app that he was going to charge $19 a month for until he was called out for it and then was going to charge $49 until quot un quote the beta ends and that previously mentioned rudimentary airplane game it generates around $67,000 a month majority of which is from advertising as you can see from the blimps and other objects around in the game and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with trying to make a product Market it and then try to make a profit even if it's with AI the problem is with Vibe coding and Vibe coders they don't maintain their projects and I fear that they might not be able to maintain their projects fly Peter is nearly unplayable I run a 3070 and I experience bug after bug crash after crash basic game mechanics that would probably take 5 minutes of research and probably 5 minutes of implementations like collisions don't work my assumption is that the game got too out of hand and the AI is no longer able to fix these bugs and since this game was Vibe coded and only made through AI prompts he most likely doesn't understand the codebase well enough to fix this and he's also not an experienced Game Dev to understand how to resolve these bugs quickly and that is completely fine I am not a Game Dev either and I would love to make a video game but I don't think Vibe coding is the process to make any long-term project you will no longer be able to maintain your own code you aren't learning anything new and your product is going to suffer in the end the success of fly Peter other Vibe coding projects came out like this tank game and it's riddled with even more bugs and even more problems funny enough an experienced game developer noticed that every time a tank shoots it grabs the audio file from the server every single time instead of caching it on local and initially to someone without experience it might not sound that bad but with a little bit of research and a little bit of work and learning you'd realize that is a very inefficient method and you should instead cash the sound on the machine the continue continue on none of these projects are open source we can't even take a look at how they're implemented there's very little open source contribution made by these projects instead it really is a goal of only monetizing I actually tried asking for a GitHub repo from one of these projects and I got ghosted um it wasn't from specifically fly Peter or any of the projects I showed here but there has been no GitHub repo no links that I can find to see what the quality of the source code actually is and that also brings up the question of security for these Vibe coded SAS apps we can't take a look at the source code we don't know if the developers of these Vibe coded apps actually know best security practices and I think that's my main gripe with Vibe coding it's because code is seen as a nuisance as an obstacle to overcome to push a product and make as much money as possible there isn't any passion or love for the code or the implementation of the product and that's not every Vibe coder I'm sure that the majority actually want to learn from this code but a lot of that is overshadowed by trying to churn out as many products as quick as possible and ironically one of the most successful Vibe coded projects I found was a course on how to code and maybe I'm just too obsessed with code and computers and I'm jealous of all of the profits that these people people are able to make but I disagree with the vibe coding mentality of disregarding the code and the process and trying to just optimize and push out products as quick as possible but that's ironic coming from me since I'm A vibe video maker though if you like this video and before I get flexed on by thousands of vibe coders making tens of thousands of dollars more than me please like And subscribe and thanks for watching", "duration(in seconds)": 384.0, "region": "US"}}

introduced their latest new update which is the version 3.5 release we're slowly but surely getting close to 4.0 and I can't wait for what they have in stock for that upgrade but with this current 3.5 release they've enabled the expanding thinking option for CLA 3.7 Sonet to get better reasoning for code generation there's a new mCP response type they've also added language preferences new model providers which includes groc but you still can't access the groc 3 API yet and a few other things that we're going to be taking a look at as we go further into the video but for the people who do not know what client is it's an autonomous coding agent directly within your IDE capable of creating editing files executing commands using the browser and much more with your permission each step of the way now that we have that out of the way let's get started and showcase all the new highlights of part of this version 3.5 release before we get started I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis so this is where you can easily get upto-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space so definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free let's first start off with the expanded thinking incline with claw 3.7 Sonet where you have the ability to enable extended thinking and this is within the settings option option and this allows Cent to allocate separate thinking budgets for plan and act modes when you're using the cloud 3.7 Sonic model but what does this basically mean it means that client is going to be more thoughtful and strategic and this is by adjusting these budgets that will enable you to control how much reasoning power the AI dedicates to different stages of your coding process for example if you're using the plan mode they recommend that you use a higher thinking budget which is going to improve decision making strategies on your development as well as the overall project planning it's going to ensure that client carefully evaluates different approaches before it executes with the ACT mode this is where you can set a lower budget with this mode and it's going to be more suitable for quicker execution tasks like writing code modifying files or even running commands efficiently but now you have more customizable options and adaptability when you're working with this Cloud 3.7 Sonet model as you can use this expanded thinking to execute better generations with the plan mode and then have it executed with the ACT mode last week we saw the introduction of client's mCP Marketplace which is your One-Stop shop for Endless tools that you can add to client mCP servers are basically plugins that connect clients your favorite tools and enables direct AI interaction with your daily apps with just one single click within this Marketplace you can have it installed into cine and then have it powered within your workspace and have it as a companion with these different apps and now with the client version 3.5 release it brings richer more interactive mCP responses with visual content Rich displays where you have automatic image previews and this is going to enable you to see different types of images instantly without extra clicks on the web you have Rich link previews which gives you website thumbnails and detailed summaries you have enhanced tool out puts where you can actually view charts graphs as well as different visualizations directly within the chat interface of client and lastly you have seamless mode switching where you can toggle between Rich displays and plain text for a tailored experience and essentially this is making the whole approach towards mCP more intuitive more insightful and Visually engaging so it's easier for developers to use another new feature is that Klein now supports all API available grock mod models which is going to expand your AI capabilities with the two main models that grock provides excluding the grock 3 cuz it's not fully available through API yet but it will be soon but you can now access these two main models from Gro the gro 2 and the grock 2 Vision rocku is going to enable you access to its 131k token context window which is ideal for handling large code bases the gr to Vision on the other hand is going to allow you support for image analysis with with accurate pricing implementation and overall this is going to bring you deeper context understanding with powerful Vision capabilities at a cheap price so it's definitely a great add-on to now access it via clein oh they also added support for the GPT 4.5 which I don't know why you would want to use it but you can now access it through Klein now if you're looking to install Klein it's super easy to do so you can easily install it for any IDE in this case it's preferred to use vs code but you can use cursor wi surf or any of the other ones that are out there and once you have installed an ID you can head over to Microsoft's Marketplace and you can go ahead and click on install and it'll open it up within your IDE you can then go over to the marketplace stop and you can go ahead and install this now since I have it already installed I'm going to need to go ahead and update it to the latest release to access the new features so go ahead and update it and then restart the extension and then you can go over to client and then access the new update a feature I didn't mention is that if you go over to the settings tab you can go over to advanced settings and you can head over to the section that says uh preferred language and this is where you can set your language to whatever preferred language that is available from Spanish all the way to something like Portuguese so you can go ahead and set this and then have the responses I'll put it in that language to give you a rough idea of what you can do with mCP servers had head over to the marketplace and what you can actually do is look through all the different types of plugins and essentially you have different categories from browser automation all the way to something like virtualization so let's go over to all categories and let's take a look at something that we can easily get started with something that comes straight to my mind is integration of super base or subase you can go ahead and click install and this will allow you to easily integrate the inte ation of sub base within client so that's it's easier for you to set up full stack apps with this extension so it makes the process of creating databases as well as authentification systems quite easily with this plugin so after it autonomously installs mCP server for me we can then go ahead and access it so it looks like it is now set up so in this case what you can do is you can have user management controlled within client you have SSO configuration as well as authenication control so what you can do is you can say show me the latest uh databased schemas in your sub based project and it will actually give you a list of all that and you can also ask it something like list all the public tables or public schemas we can ask at that and it'll actually give us insights on this as it will use the mCP server so you can see it is using the Subways mpcp server and it's going to be able to list out all the tables for tables and Views in schema as well as their sizes if you like this video and would love to support the channel you can consider donating to my Channel Through the super thanks option below or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on a monthly basis plus daily AI news and exclusive content plus a lot more but that's basically a gist of the new client version 3.5 update I definitely recommend that you try this out it's small but it's definitely packed with a lot of different things so I definitely recommend that you try it out with all the links in the description below make sure you subscribe to the newsletter so that you can stay up to date with the latest AI contents make sure you follow me on the patreon

just a spectator in this high-tech Showdown what you see here is India's own fifth generation fighter jet called Advanced medium combat aircraft or amka being developed by the aeronautical development agency while this is still under development stage this is the first time that a model of the Amai is being showcased in a public forum in a public platform at the AO India show here [Music] we have with us the man who's heading the project for India's fifth generation aircraft am Mr nagesh KS so thank you so much for joining us uh tell us more about this technology because we already seeing fifth generation uh fighter jets flying outside how far are we from having our own fighter jet uh in the skies see as you see today in the AO India show there is a F35 and F2 Su 57 and I would equally say that amka is the Indian answer to the world in terms of the fifth generation fighter jet what we have been producing the capabilities of the this aircraft are equally or at par I would say with all the current generation fighter jets which you have been seeing in the air SH now we have completed the critical design of this aircraft and we are now in to the stage of manufacturing of this so you will see the prototypes of this aircraft populated with all the systems together flying very soon we are targeting this by possibly the end of 2027 to in the first quarter of 20128 you can see this aircraft the aircraft is done in a shaping in such a way that there is no radar signature which will be given to an enemy radar so we have done the shape in such a way by shaping itself you get about 70 to 80% of its the stealth capability out of this aircraft by the airframe platform then by when can we see amka joining the Air Force Fleet as we said we to take and build this aircraft it takes about 2 to 2 and half years from now from then on there is lot of flight testing we will have to do to evaluate the every performance which we have planned as a design parameter so all these design parameters will be validated during the flight testing process and then as and when we finish of that maybe possibly in terms of uh the timelines maybe it may take about 2 and half years to 3 years timeline we should be daing the service does that mean 5 years from now on maybe we target about 5 years stealth comes basically from the pl form of this aircraft you can see that the edge edges the way in which it is shed edges can see the shapes of this aircraft which have been made in such a way that there are no Reflections coming out of this aircraft even the sertion whatever you see the reflections will get absorbed into it and then we use more and more radar absorbing structures radar absorbing paints to absorb the radar signatures and then it will not emit out of this air these are the internal weapons which are there in this area internal weapons means as I said you this is the Beyond visual range missile which has the capability of Target reaching up to about 100 km from the point of its trigger so we have air to a capability and air to ground capability these are the air to ground weapons which these are called Glide bombs which are about having about 80 km of range and that is also equivalent of that so these are all completely indigenous weapons developed by our drdo laboratory sister Laboratories and then these are the ones which are going to be embedded inside to the internal weapon Bay of amka and this will be fired by the pilots based on the requirements as the aircraft is having the swing roll capability lot of sensors on this aircraft the sensor data Fusion is one important technology which we have been embarking in this country and this sensor data Fusion helps the pilot to assertain the Target its proper coordinates or the location and then he will be able to take a proper decision in firing a right weapon onto the target there are several adversaries which have been there to the aircraft by itself like you know the aircraft is approached through a uh missile or something now aircraft can take a decision to know release its weaponary or take an evasive action by releasing some shaft and flares this been already automated onto this aircraft and the technology levels towards this have been worked out by our scientists and engineers and when you see the amka flying all these technologies will be embedded into the and this is what makes the amka uh 5.5 generation and when it be entered to the service it will still be [Music] [Music] contemporary thank you for watching us on CNBC TV8 for all news and updates subscribe subbe to

the window that pops up look for channel and then go to advanced settings click on manage to access the account settings here you can create a new YouTube channel then visit chat GPT and ask it to generate a list of 10 names for a finance Channel make sure to ask for short and easy to remember names once you have the list pick one you find interesting for example I'm going with wealthwise copy the name go back to YouTube paste it and click on create that's it the channel has been created but we still need to make it look good it's time to create the logo I will use chat GPT for this step I just need to copy the prompt from the Google Doc and go back to chat GPT The Prompt is asking chat GPT to provide a text prompt that can be used to generate a logo using any AI image generator I will open an AI image generator like gencraft for this after pasting The Prompt in the AI image generator I need to make sure that the settings are right I should click on enhance prompt to help reconstruct the prompt and select realistic for image style before clicking on generate after generating the image I'll download it and then go back to YouTube click on customize Channel and move to channel branding then I'll click on upload and add my logo the next step is to generate a viral script which is one of the most important steps you really don't want to mess this up so make sure to follow these instructions carefully firstly copy this prompt and ask chat GPT to provide a list of a 100 YouTube ideas related to personal finance give the AI some time and it will generate a 100 video video ideas that have the potential to go viral for example how to create a budget that works is a good topic that people will want to watch as well as saving money on a low income I'm thinking of making a video about how to pay off debt faster so what I'll do is copy this prompt go back to the Google Doc change the first line to the topic of my choice and then paste the whole prompt in chat GPT GPT will write a very interesting script that will keep viewers engaged the next step is to create a voice over to do this visit 11 labs to choose a voice actor the first thing you need to do is

the scene real quick make sure you listen to the voice before downloading and add Clips to the timeline for better presentation next add animation to the text by clicking on animation and selecting a suitable style such as typewriter pops out copy and paste this template into all the empty parts of the video for example rightclick to copy move the timer to the next empty part paste it and adjust it to fit then change the text for each part now let's add Transitions and effects to make the video more engaging click on Transitions and choose a transition such as warp Zoom 6 drag and adjust the transition duration as needed for effects Select Auto enhance and ensure that it covers the entire timeline let's add some background music click on audio and search for tutorial music listen to different tracks to find one you like then click add to project to include the audio after after adding the music reduce the volume to minus 16 so that the voice can be heard clearly next add captions to the video and then you can export it while the video is exporting let's quickly summarize what we have done so far first we created a brand new YouTube channel then we used AI to generate our logo and chat GPT to create our script after that we utilized 11 labs for the voiceover and wondershare for video editing can return to YouTube to upload the video while the video is processing in the meantime we can head over to canva and create the the video thumbnail first open canva and click on create a new design then select YouTube thumbnail before you start designing it's a good idea to check your competitor's channels and see the style of thumbnails they use for example if you search for how to pay off debt on YouTube you can get an idea of what works based on that you can decide what to create for my thumbnail I'll add a black background set it as the background and then upload an image of a person holding a credit card I'll add text saying no debt and change the colors leaving the word debt in red after after that I'll need to adjust the position by clicking on position and then layers I'll drag the image above the text and then my thumbnail will be ready to download and upload to Youtube you can also ask chat GPT to write a video description copy the text and paste it into the description box then click on public and save if you want your channel to grow faster there are two things you must do number one is consistency without consistency you are not going to make it secondly it's difficult but that's just the truth coming up with ideas editing the videos and all these things take time but I can definitely assure you that it will be worth it in the end secondly you need to engage with your community always reply to comments this will make people keep coming to your channel and that is just what the YouTube algorithm needs to recommend your videos to more people finally let's discuss monetization there are various ways to monetize this kind of content for example you can make money through YouTube monetization sponsorships and by selling your own courses YouTube has changed many people's lives including mine you just have to put in the work and believe me you will definitely see the results it's just a matter of time thank you and peace", "duration(in seconds)": 545.0, "region": "US"}}

With the first people to step foot on the moon, NASA apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin having left the site, they also left behind different experiments including a seismometer, the laser lunar retroflector and commemorative items such as soviet medals and an apollo 1 mission patch. In this space video I am revisiting a significant historical site, Tranquility Base, that noone has has visited since.", "tags": "moon, nasa, space, neil armstrong, first step on the moon, lunar, scifi, sci-fi, tranquility, base, experiments, 3d animation, explaining, educational, us flag, lunar module, eagle, rocket, apollo 11", "script": "NASA Radio:\"Eagle (this is) Houston, looking good\" After 21h and 36m on the surface of the Moon it was time for the first people to walk here, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to start heading home NASA Radio: \"nine, eight, seven, six, five, abort stage, engine arm ascent, proceed\" In this video we will look at what the \nastronauts left behind on what is one   of the most significant historical \nsites that no one has visited since   During the astronauts takeoff Buzz Aldrin observed \nthe site from a window noticing that the engine's  spearing exhaust was whirling up Moon dust and \ncaused the American flag to tip over falling   to the ground. A special mounting mechanism had \nbeen designed for the flag as with no wind on the   moon it had to be held upright by a horizontal \ncrossbar. The flag itself however made of nylon   is not a custom-made product but was ordered \nthrough the standard government supply catalog In addition to the flag, other commemorative \nitems that serve no scientific purpose were   left on the moon. Attached on the ladder of \nThe Descent stage there is a metal plaque   featuring the signatures of the Apollo 11 \ncrew and then U.S president Richard Nixon The astronauts also placed a number of small objects \nwith symbolic meaning on the surface.  These items were stored in a shoulder pocket on Buzz aldrin's \nspacesuit and he almost forgot to leave them on the   moon and was reminded to do so by Armstrong \nwhile he was already on the ladder to re-enter  the lunar module. From there Aldrin dropped the \nobjects onto the lunar surface. Part of it was an Apollo 1 Mission patch to honor the astronauts \nthat had died in a tragic accident two and a half   years prior. Their cabin had caught fire during a \nlaunch rehearsal killing all three crew members   The astronauts also left two commemorative medals \nto honor the Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin   and Vladimir komarov: two space Pioneers \nthat died in different tragic accidents   Even amidst the Cold War the aim was \nto express mutual respect for those   who risked their lives for the exploration \nof space. Another object that was placed to   express the spirit of international \ncooperation is a small silicon disk   Tt contains Goodwill messages from the leaders \nof 73 countries around the world. In addition it   features the names of Congress members responsible \nfor NASA legislation as well as names of NASA senior staff. The astronauts also left a gold \nOlive Branch as a symbol of Global Peace. Besides these purely symbolic objects \nwe can find instruments that we used for   experiments such as this seismometer \nthat can measure ground vibrations   The device, powered by solar panels, \nrecords data on the strength, duration   and approximate direction of seismic \nevents and transmits this data to Earth   Unfortunately just three weeks after the moon \nlanding the device stopped sending data back   presumably because it overheated in the midday \nSun. The temperature fluctuations between day   and night are much more extreme than on Earth. \nThis is because the sun's heat is not absorbed   by an atmosphere, which could distribute \nit and retain it during the night Further we find another experiment, the lunar \nlaser retro reflector, it acts as a special kind   of mirror reflecting incoming light in exactly \nthe same direction from which the beam originates   This means scientists on Earth can direct \na laser beam towards this device which will   reflect the light back to Earth. Since the \nspeed of light is known, this instrument can   be used to measure the exact distance between \nthe Earth and the moon. And it is the mission's   only experiment that still works to this day.\nOther experiments that the astronauts carried   out can only be recognized by the traces \nthey left behind. The astronauts took rock samples and drilled into the ground measuring the \nresistance. They also hung up a special sheet for   the duration of their stay in order to measure \nthe solar wind outside of Earth's magnetosphere   Because the astronauts had to bring this sail \nback to Earth, only the pole remains on the moon   Close to the Lander we find an area that is \ncluttered with objects. This is the trash we left behind. A number of rock samples were brought \nback to Earth and in order to be able to take as   much as possible of those the astronauts tossed \naway equipment that had already served its purpose   Also the black and white camera which had \ntransmitted both the first steps on the moon, and the raising of the flag to a worldwide \naudience stayed behind on the moon In addition to commemorative items, scientific \nexperiments, and tossed away equipment, the astronauts left one other thing behind: their \nfootprints, which are often used as a metaphor   for the achievement that this journey represents.\nThe paths that the astronauts took are clearly   visible in the moondust and they reveal one path \nthat was taken far away from the landing site   Towards the end of the extra vehicular \nactivity Neil Armstrong took the chance   and went on an unplanned trip to \nthe little West crater. After the astronauts left, the site's condition \nis expected to only change slow, not so much in   periods of weeks or months but decades centuries \nand even greater intervals. And so today more than   53 years after Apollo 11 left, it can be assumed \nthat solar radiation has visually changed the site   Without a significant atmosphere to protect \nthe moon, the intense ultraviolet radiation of   sunlight will have an impact on the materials \nused in the mission. It is widely assumed that   the colors of the U.S flag have faded \nover the years. In addition the materials   were exposed to the extreme temperature \nfluctuations alternating between 14 days   of 100 degrees celsius heat and then 14 days \nin the dark at negative 150 degrees celsius   And so it's likely that the nylon flag is \nalso tattered and disintegrated as other   materials will have suffered and will be covered \nin dust. Ultimately however these are assumptions   to the best of our knowledge, what's left is a \ntruly fascinating historical site that unlike   archaeological sites on Earth is superbly \npreserved but yet hardly studyable. If you find find yourself far away from \nhome you might notice that your favorite TV   shows are not available. That is because they \nare region locked. Luckily this can simply be   avoided by using my sponsor NordVPN, as their \nservice lets you choose from dozens of locations   currently limited to planet Earth. This means \nyou can access sites and streaming content that   is not available in your own country, thereby \nexpanding what you get from your subscriptions   And I have also found that it fixes a ton of \nissues common when browsing while traveling   like those websites that automatically default \nto the local language and currency, or poorly   implemented login security the results in you \nconstantly having to re-authenticate that it's   actually you browsing. NordVPN has been useful \nfor me in tons of different ways and the best   part is that you can try it with no risk. \nNordvpn has a 30-day money-back guarantee   so go ahead and try it for yourself by \ngetting an additional four months for free   at nordvpn.com/neovpn or click the link on \nthe screen.

Trump believes these tariffs will boost US manufacturing, but economist Mark Zandi predicts the tariffs will result in higher prices and less US jobs.  #CNN #News", "tags": "latest news, Happening Now, Trump Tariffs, President Donald Trump, Trump Administration, Canada Tariffs, Mexico Tariffs, Inflation, US Economy, Canadian Prime Minister, Canadian Government, Canada US Relations, Dairy Tariff, Lumber Tariff, Mark Carney, Canada Liberal Party, Toronto, Melanie Joly, Auto Tariffs, Kate Bolduan, CNN News Central, Mark Zandi, Becky Anderson, Connect the World, Allison Stewart, CNNB, CNN Business", "script": "How about this for a warning from one auto industry expert? The price of new cars in the U.S. will skyrocket in coming weeks, and maybe even sooner than you think. After President Trump announced 25% tariffs are coming on all cars and car parts shipped to the U.S., there's probably not a vehicle on the market today that wouldn't be affected in some form or fashion by tariffs. Leaders of some of America's biggest trading partners, also known as some of America's closest allies, are pushing back hard overnight. About this try on another warning for size from the Premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, that 65 billion of tariffs that we have on the table that we can launch towards the U.S., we have to run through every tariff and minimize the pain for Canadians. Maximize the pain for Americans. And I feel terrible for the Americans. But it's one person, as President Trump, that's creating this chaos. Joining us right now is Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics. It's good to see you, Mark. Thank you for coming in. 25% tariffs coming for cars and basically all cars since it also applies to car parts. What is this going to mean. What's your analysis on what people need to be preparing for. Well Kate it means higher prices and it means fewer jobs. I mean, on the higher price side, you know, a lot of moving parts here, a lot of uncertainty. But, I think if, the if the tariffs are imposed as articulated and stay in place by this time next year, the typical car price will be somewhere between 5000 and $10,000 more. so, you know, right now, the average car, car price is 50 K, so that means you're going to be paying 55 K to 60 K as a result of the tariffs. And then I do expect that it's going to cost jobs. you know, you'll see retaliation just toward the Canadian Canadians talk about this. Other countries will respond no doubt. And that means, where U.S. manufacturers are going to have trouble selling what they produce to those countries, you know, cost jobs, and you don't really need to go too far back to see this. If you go back to President Trump's first term and look at, what happened with manufacturing activity, jobs and prices, the tariffs, resulted in the kind of damage that I'm talking about. So and here we're talking about much higher tariffs. So I, I buckle in I think this means higher prices and fewer jobs because and that was what I was going to ask you next. Because Donald Trump, the president says that this is being done to protect American manufacturers, to save American workers. The UAW president, Jon Faine, applauded the decision, saying it's a step in the direction to end the free trade disaster, is how he put it. What are the chances this does not negatively affect American consumers? Now I just don't see it. I really don't, you know, take a if you just put yourself in the position of a CEO of a major global manufacturer and you're looking at this and you're thinking, should I build a vehicle factory in the United States? And by the way, Kate, to build a factory takes years, as you know, he can't build for next month, next quarter. This is something that takes two, 3 or 4 years, and then you're building it to last for years after that and maybe even decades. And what's the tariff going to be tomorrow? What's the tariff going to be six months from now? What's the tariff going to be a year from now? What's the tariff going to be five years from now? because all this is done under executive orders, not in the legislation. This is in which a change in the stroke of a pen. So that's the you know, who's going to say, I'm not going to invest, I'm just going to sit on my hands. So I just don't see it. I'm confused by it. help me be un less confused about also now the following, if you look at it all together, I mean, you said a couple of weeks ago the risk of recession is uncomfortably high because of how markets are reacting to tariffs. And in part, we learned this week, consumer confidence slid to its lowest level since January 2021. Add it all up. What is the economic outlook looking like since the new administration came in? Well highly uncertain. You know, I've been a professional economist for 35 years, and there's a few other times in that 35 years where the uncertainty is as thick as it is today. I mean, you know, maybe 911, the global financial crisis, the pandemic. I mean, it's incredibly uncertain in that kind of world. people freeze at first, and then they start pulling back and cutting back in the you can see it in the surveys. You mentioned the consumer sentiment survey, the Conference Board survey. That's a really good leading indicator of recession. Now it's not screaming recession yet I don't see, you know, red flares going off yet. But it's moving in the wrong direction. And I do think it prices if we do see these kinds of tariffs go into place and prices do rise to the extent that seems likely. I think it's a lot of pressure on, consumer psychology, on business sentiment, on what the Federal Reserve Board decides to do or not do. And all those things mean recession risks are on the rise. Mark, thank you so much for jumping on this morning. Appreciate it. There is some real concern still about what President Trump will do ahead of what he is calling Liberation Day, and that is April the 2nd, when these next levies are set to go into place. And analysts are warning us car buyers to prepare for some serious sticker shock. The president announcing 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. It is a move that will significantly raise the cost of producing all cars sold there, even those built in American factories. The white House claims the levies are needed to strengthen America's manufacturing industry because of unfair trade practices and US national security concerns. All this at stake affect, of course, Saint Paul the Third, a day of deliberation day after tariffs hit a wide variety of other goods produced by America's trading partners. Right. CNN's Dana Stuart, following this story for us. Good to have you here. Analysts warning consumers to brace themselves, at least in the US, for price increases set to come fast. Just how fast and by how much? We're looking at a considerable price increase for U.S. consumers. And this could take really only a few weeks. It depends on stock levels for car manufacturers. This is one of the most interconnected sort of global sectors in the world. The Trump administration, of course, is very aware of this, but it's interesting to consider that, yes, this will impact U.S. branded U.S. made cars. You're looking at stock prices here for General Motors, Stellantis, which makes Jeep Ford GM down more than 8% today. And that's because they are very reliant on car parts from around the world, particularly Canada and Mexico. So we are going to see a big increase in prices. And in fact, some analysts today putting that at thousands of dollars a car. I think the Anderson Economic Group said that for vehicles built in the U.S., the cost between a 3500 and $12,000 a car, this is a huge cost increase. This, of course, feeds into inflation. This is not what President Trump wants. It will impact international carmakers as well, but it will even punish those that have factories in the United States like Volkswagen or BMW, because they too rely on car parts from elsewhere. And Becky, of course, it takes many, many years to shift that. So even as we see a car manufacturer like the South Korean one last week, Hyundai investing or committing to invest a lot of money in a steel manufacturing facility, it will take years for that to come on board. And in the meantime, who is getting hit? Not just economies around the world, but U.S. consumers. Yeah. What's been the reaction to President Trump's escalating global trade war? We've got a lot of reaction, Becky. You won't be surprised to hear that. Plenty of stock market reaction in Asia, Europe and of course announcing the US car stocks down really across the board. More so for those that are more impacted. And we actually can show you the countries that will be most impacted by this. Mexico, Japan, Canada, South Korea all up there. And we are now getting responses from pretty much all of them. Mexico's president due to speak soon Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a direct attack on Canada. The EU Commission president. Interesting kind of said the EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions. They have actually delayed half of their retaliatory tariffs from a few weeks ago. They're hoping clearly to have some sort of negotiation. Germany's trade minister, though much stronger, Becky, unsurprising given Germany is such a bigger automaker. What counts now is to have a firm response to these tariffs from the EU. It needs to be clear that we will not take this lying down. And of course, President Trump really doesn't like retaliation. So what are we going to see? Is it gonna be negotiation or escalation?", "duration(in seconds)": 546.0, "region": "US"}}

evidence of this fact is how the European powers really never brought to production a true fifth generation fighter and we already talked about Russia's attempt to do so in a previous video so in this video we're finally going to explore as many of you have requested in the comments section those European Fighters that are currently in production and that are currently in operation in those European nations now as I've already alluded to there are not very many of these aircraft after the fall that Berlin Wall many European power slashed the defense budgets and many really haven't returned to pre Berlin wall defense spending it's easy to tell how little truly has been spent in European development on new aircraft technology by simply looking at the aircraft that are currently in operation they're almost identical and it's been that way for over 4 for decades but I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it right which brings us to our first aircraft on our list that is so Mirage 2000 now the Mirage 2000 was designed as a lightweight replacement to the Mirage 3. but in my opinion it really doesn't bring any new advancements or updates and Technology no leaps and Innovation so really it kind of disappointed in that regard it's a fair price at about 30 million dollars giving a score of seven a top speed of Mach 2.2 earns it a score of seven on speed it's nine hard points and about 2 000 miles of Ferry range earn it a decent score of seven for versatility but as I mentioned earlier its Innovation leaves something to be desired giving in only a score of five it is however the most produced aircraft on our list today at over 600 units produced it has a wide variety of operators across the globe it however doesn't have as much air combat history scoring only one air-to-air kill and one ground loss giving it an effectivity score of seven next up also from disso its first flight was in 1986 the de so Rafal this one's primary operators are France in Greece and is a Quantum Leap in price at over 115 million dollars however you're getting a lot more bang for your buck and that price tag unfortunately earns it only a three on cost and although its top speed is slightly slower than the Mirage 2000 it has a top crew speed of 1.4 meaning it has super Cruise capabilities which means it gets a higher speed score at eight while researching these statistics I was blown away by the numbers that were fall the third best combat range of any aircraft on the fighter jet list 14 hardpoints which is the most of any fighter jet I've seen by the Numbers this should be the most versatile fighter jet I've seen I started looking at the technology I noticed that it had a phase the right radar it had super Cruise it was checking all of the boxes but then I started to look a little bit closer although it does currently have a phased array radar this was a later modification and unfortunately one thing that opened my eyes was I found out that in 2002 the rafale was actually prevented from conducting air-to-ground operations for literally five years five years where the French air force needed the refall to conduct air-to-ground operations where it just couldn't and so unfortunately I had to give versatility a score of seven so as I mentioned earlier the phase array radar and many of the advancements on the rafale were only added in later modifications so unfortunately for Innovation I also had to give the refaw a seven it has had a fairly successful production run at over 200 units and has sold pretty well to various Nations however hasn't had any air-to-air combat history to speak of so scores of six for effectivity next up we have our sweetest friends with the Saab JIS 13 9 Gripen inside of Europe This aircraft flies for the Czech Republic Sweden the UK Hungary and a variety of countries outside of Europe as well what I love about this aircraft is it's literally Ikea for Air Forces and it's exactly what you would get for quality for a cheap airplane for air forces that can't afford higher quality but it's still stylish and some assembly required so coming in at about 30 million dollars the Gripen gets an eight for cost hitters the respectable top speed of Mach 2 giving a speed score of seven the grip has 10 hard points and subpar combat range give it a six for versatility and just like you're running the middle Ikea furniture it's nothing to write home about for Innovation it's pretty much as standard as they come it gets a five average and again no combat history here to speak of but it has sold decently well for Saab and has proven to be a good production aircraft and a great budget aircraft for countries that may not be able to afford all the bells and whistles so next up we have the Bae Harrier 2 but we've actually already ranked that one in our U.S aircraft fighter jet rankings so I'm not going to go over too much detail about that one but I will recap the score for you real quick for Costa gets a six for Speed it gets a three versatility you got a five for Innovation it got a seven for effectivity it got a four and its overall score was a 5.2 and like I said if you want to learn more about that make sure you check out my video talking about the US fighter jets ranked last but certainly not least was the Euro Fighter typhoon this was a multinational design effort with the likes of Leonardo Bae and Airbus which were Italian British and French companies respectively the primary operators of the typhoon are now the UK Germany Italy and Spain the typhoon definitely comes with the price tag I don't over 124 million dollars giving it a score of two on cost but it definitely is fast and it has super Cruise as well so it gets an 8 on speed for versatility it has 13 hard points and is able to perform a variety of functions from Air superiority to air to ground operations so it gets an eight for versatility as well not only does this aircraft have supercruise but it also has a phase array radar and has a reduced radar cross section this is certainly one of the most advanced aircraft in the world and although it's not a fifth generation aircraft nor is it all aspects stealth it incorporates radar absorbing materials known as RAM to reduce its radar cross section this is why some would classify this aircraft as a fourth plus generation instead of just a fourth generation aircraft so without any further Ado we finally have the ranking of all five of the currently operational European produced and European flown aircraft on the top the eurofighter typhoon the daso Rafal The desso Mirage 2000 the Saab grippin and finally the Bae Harrier too so just a quick update for you I know I haven't posted in a while this is a new set because I moved houses and new state I've started a new master's program uh I have a lot a lot of changes in the past couple months so thank you for bearing with me and thank you for watching this video I've had a lot of new subscribers so thank you and welcome to the channel for all of you new um I'm gonna have a lot of new videos coming out so thank you and thank you for your patience so if you want to see the full ranking list make sure you check out the next couple of my videos because I'm going to be completing the ranking list coming up soon I'm going to be ranking all of the Russian operational fighter jets as well coming up

subprime market This is a combination of economic problems and things which are flowing through into financial problems And to be honest we haven't seen a reordering of the global economic system on this scale since the 1930s And that was the smooth holy tariffs which certainly didn't cause the Great Depression but were contributors to that And also on the other side on the financial side the excesses that have built up over the last 20 years are far greater than I've ever seen before And I think the critical thing there is there's a complete disconnect between cash and earnings and valuations So the difference between valuations and everything else has become stretched So I don't know how bad it would could be but all I know looking at history is it could be very bad And so what you are saying is that an economic downturn comparable to the great depression of the 1930s is not inconceivable Certainly it's not inconceivable And I think the caution I have is this is like going to a football match and the national anthems haven't finished playing and we're trying to judge how the game ends And it's almost impossible to do that Unlike the banking crisis of 2008 and the share market crash of 1929 the catalyst for this latest crisis has been the US president himself Is it within his power to undo the damage he's already done well the best thing I could say is what leenencia once said which is it's difficult to make an aquarium from fish soup So basically he has tried to undo the entire economic system as it's existed for 40 or 50 years and I think the loss of trust in the US loss of trust in the basic way the US has operated is very very critical to understand and I would not be surprised if it's very difficult to go back from there and the other interesting issue is that one of the questions I have is the intellectual caliber of the people involved Mark Twain once said that he didn't know about the people who ruling who were ruling us that whether they were very smart people putting us on or they were imbecile who really meant it and we are still trying to work that out Well what do you make of what Donald Trump and the White House is trying to achieve the stated aims whether it could work well I think you have to go to Shakespeare which is if there's be madness there is method in it because the there's a plan here and the plan is to try to address a wide range of US grievances which range from the loss of manufacturing jobs It looks at things like basically national security There is things like the budget deficit the trade deficit the overvalued dollar and the role the US dollar plays in the financial system globally as a reserve currency He's trying to address all of that and tariffs is just one part of that program and probably the one that's most overlooked is what is known loosely as the Mirin plan This is a way to try to address the US budget deficit trade deficit and also US debt And that would involve believe it or not taking US government bonds or a certain portion of them and forcibly converting that into 100red-year or perpetual bonds with low coupons Alternatively they could charge user fees for US treasuries And those types of measures including capital controls are a complete reversal of what we have seen over the last 40 or 50 years of globalization So this is part of a plan and the problem is we really don't know how many bits of it are going to get actually implemented when they'll be implemented because what we've seen is the whole process is entirely erratic You know people embrace the idea of creative destruction All I'm seeing now is destruction without any creativity And so do you think it could work or do you think we're going to see a flight of capital away from the United States or something else well I think if they start to play with the dollar which they are to some extent already they've tried to devalue the dollar I think once you start to play with that the loss of confidence will mean essentially that overseas holders of US assets will start to sell And at the margin that makes it very difficult for the US in several layers The first is the dollar will crash which will actually make the tariff problem worse because in the 2016 time when he put tariffs on the appreciation in the US dollar actually offset part of the cost of the tariffs and that'll be the reverse Now the second thing is if there is a loss of confidence in US treasuries interest rates around the world will move up holders of US treasuries overseas like the Chinese the Japanese and also other East Asian and also the pro states will start to sell pushing up interest rates And because US treasuries play such a big part in setting interest rates around the world it will completely destabilize the international financial system It's all very well for somebody to say I'm going to change things but you got to have a very clear idea of what the endgame is and how you get there without disrupting anything Unfortunately I don't see that plan currently A lot of analysts argue that Australia is well placed to weather these shifts What is your view australia is better placed than most We're not terribly dependent on the US in terms of trade but it's the secondary effects because of our reliance on China which is obviously involved in a cage fight with the United States for dominance And the second thing is if the global economy itself slows we'll be affected That's the first thing We have a bit of ammunition in terms of that our debt positions are not as bad as other people's But there's a fundamental dilemma which nobody wants to talk about which is a geopolitical one because economically we're completely dependent on China because it accounts for somewhere between 35 and 50% of our actual exports on the other side our cultural political geostrategic links are to the United States particularly for security And I think Joe BLK Peterson once said that you know you can't run along a barb wire fence with a foot on either side And we've done that for a long period of time and we're going to have to choose I think we need to understand what Henry Kissinger once put forward which is that it was dangerous to be America's enemy but to be America's friend was fatal and we are now caught in that dilemma and unfortunately I don't see any real attempt to address that dichotomy Is that going to be one of the most pressing issues for the next federal government to address whatever its composition i don't think it matters who's in government I think we are going to have to deal with these issues and I think fundamentally we need to have a couple of principles which I don't see being talked about The first is we have to do what Lord Palmerston once says that countries don't have permanent friends they have permanent interests and we have to reconcile our interests The second thing is we have to be extremely pragmatic about how we go about this And the last element to this which is probably the most dangerous is that we need to actually be able to manage these things dynamically over time in an environment which is extremely volatile Short

competitive programmer in history started his journey at just 6 years old yeah we're talking about a guy known as tourist who's won every single major competition and turned down Millions from Tech Giants just to pursue his love of computer science so how exactly did a kid from Belarus become the Undisputed goat of competitive programming well let's hold on a second to understand genned katovich we need to take it back to September 25th 1994 when a child was born in the city of gol bellarus to two programming professors who had no idea their son would rewrite history ged's parents Vladimir and leoda katovich were programmers at the Francis skarina homeo State University's mathematics Department little did they know their son would become the greatest competitive programmer in history at just 6 years old young Gennady showed an unusual fascination with his parents work this wasn't the typical childhood curiosity there was something different about the way he approached problems the way his mind worked his father recognizing this spark designed a special children's game to introduce him to programming Concepts but nobody could have predicted how quickly this spark would ignite into a roaring Flame by age 8 gennady's Talent caught the attention of Mel delinsky one of belarus's most respected computer science teachers delinsky recalls a remarkable moment as a second grader at a national competition he he solved a problem about a body immersed in water without even knowing about Archimedes principle of buoyancy this was the first sign that they were dealing with an extraordinary mind the competitive programming world first stood up and took notice when at the unprecedented age of 11 genned qualified for the 2006 International Olympiad in informatics this wasn't just breaking the record it was shattering it most competitors were high school seniors genady was barely in Middle school he didn't just participate he won silver in his first attempt a feat that would have been the crowning achievement of most programmers careers for Gennady it was just the beginning What followed was a display of dominance never before seen in competitive programming from 2007 to 2012 Gennady won six consecutive gold medals at the II to put this in perspective most programmers dream of winning just one medal in their entire career gened won Gold six times in a row often finishing first overall he wasn't just winning he was revolutionizing how problems were solved approaching challenges with a creativity and efficiency that left even the judges in awe at the 2009 II in plav div a 14-year-old genedy showed remarkable humility that would become his trademark I try various strategies and one of them is the right one he said I am no genius I am simply good at it this modesty combined with his extraordinary Talent only added to his Legend unlike many who might let success consume their lives genned maintained balance spending no more than 3 to 4 hours daily at the computer making time for football and table tennis in 2012 gennady's Journey took him to Russia's prestigious itmo University this move marked the beginning of a new chapter in his already illustrious career in 2013 he led itmo to victory in the international Collegiate programming contest World Finals defeating Powerhouse teams from Shanghai jao Tong University and the University of Tokyo this Victory showcased not just his individual Brilliance but his ability to excel in team environments but it was in individual competitions where genned truly rewrote the history books his dominance at Google code Jam is the stuff of Legend eight consecutive championships from 2014 to 2022 think about that for a moment for eight years the best programmers from around the world gathered to compete and eight times they all went home second place to genedy add to this three Facebook hacker cup victories and you begin to understand the breadth of his dominance on coding platforms gennady's achievements border on the mythical on code forces he became the first and only person to break the 4,000 ELO barrier a rating so high that a new category had to be created just for him fittingly named tourist after his handle this achievement stands as a testament to his unparalleled skill with over 2,600 problems solved he's not just setting records he's creating benchmarks that might never be matched his dominance extends across every major competitive programming platform he holds the highest possible rating on COD Chef as a sevenstar coder he tops the rankings on top coder atcoder and hacker rank this isn't just succcess this is complete and total dominance of an entire field despite his unprecedented success ged's choices reveal a character as remarkable as his talent when Tech giants like Google and Yandex Came Calling with lucrative job offers he declined choosing instead to pursue his PhD at itmo University in a world where technical Talent often follows the highest bidder genned chose to follow his passion for computer science and research in August 2024 genned achieved what many thought impossible breaking the 4,000 ELO barrier on code forces this Milestone required the creation of a new rating category as the previous highest category legendary grandmas only went up to 3,000 the new tourist category with its distinctive red first letter and black remainder stands as a testament to his unparalleled achievements his consistency is perhaps his most remarkable trait even now he maintains a strict practice schedule solving complex algorithmic problems daily while pursuing his PhD at itmo University While others burned out ged's methodical approach limiting practice to 3 to 4 hours daily and maintaining outside interests has kept him at the top for over a decade the numbers tell the story over 2600 problems solved on code forces alone eight consecutive Google code Jam victories from 2014 to 2022 the first and only person to break the 4,000 ELO barrier a feat that forced code forces to create an entirely new ranking category his handled tourist now represents more than a username it's become the highest possible achievement in competitive programming his influence extends far beyond the rankings through his teaching at itmo University and his competition strategies he's revolutionized how problems are approached young programmers study his Solutions like grandmas chess games learning from his elegant approaches to seemingly impossible challenges despite offers from Tech Giants worth millions he chose to stay in Academia focusing on advancing computer science rather than corporate success Jed's Legacy isn't just about the records he's broken or the competitions he's won it's about proving that with the right approach dedication and strategic thinking you can achieve what others consider impossible from that curious 6-year-old in bellarus to becoming the Undisputed master of competitive programming his journey shows that true greatness comes from consistent Excellence not just fleeting moments of Brilliance the legend of tourist continues to grow at an age when many retire from competitive programming genned katovich keeps pushing boundaries solving problems in ways that leave even veteran programmers in awe he hasn't just dominated the field he's redefined what's possible in

Fischer was a medical technician while his father Samuel Steven worked as a high school teacher during his teenage years his family moved to Fullerton and seal continued his education at bua Park High School sigal's first job was as a dishwasher at a restaurant called The Wagon Wheel noticing his quick movements a Japanese shodokan karate expert who was the cook at the restaurant decided to give

Japan with his father who was visiting the country for military reasons and they decided to stay there permanently many might not know that Brock Lesnar also competed in Japan after leaving WWE Lesnar did not immediately run to the NFL or UFC instead he fought in New Japan Pro Wrestling Lesnar once won the heavyweight championship in a fantastic fashion in his first match defeating opponents with a

Japanese term is used in various martial arts to honor senior martial arts practitioners furthermore seagull became the first Foreigner in Japan to successfully run an iido Dojo iido is a Japanese martial art developed in the early 20th century by moriba iido focuses on harmonizing with an opponent's energy rather than directly opposing it iido techniques involve circular movements that redirect the opponent's Force using their momentum against them iido practitioners typically avoid direct confrontation preferring to guide attacks into controlled movements the techniques in iido emphasize efficiency using minimal physical strength by applying joint locks throws and precise strikes combat in ieto often involves manipulating the attacker's joints such as the wrist elbow or shoulder to immobilize or off-balance them to defend themselves practitioners often deflect attacks by blending with the incoming for force and redirecting it through circular movements this technique focuses on disrupting the opponent's balance making them vulnerable to being subdued iido techniques can also be adapted to various combat situations making them versatile for different types of opponents in arenas overall the philosophy of iiko with its emphasis on blending circular movements and minimal force distinguishes it as a martial art focused on Harmony and effective self-defense on

he's destroying his initial appearance involved him entering the ring and demolishing other wrestlers in His official WWE debut match against Jeff Hardy Lesnar not only defeated Hardy but also knocked him out WWE matches ending in a knockout are extremely rare but Brock Lesnar managed to KO Jeff Hardy which significantly boosted his Fame after leaving WWE and njpw Lesnar sought other Pursuits that kept him within the realm of Sports and professional fighting he eventually succeeded in joining MMA and secured a contract with UFC during Lesnar is the new UFC Brock Lesnar also of similar weight few seemed able to match his combination of muscle mass and speed his fighting style can be summarized as ground and pound which means he moved quickly to take down his opponent he typically moved to the side to gain control and then began attacking with punches and elbows while ensuring he kept his opponent pinned beneath up against big TR try to finish it he wasn't the toughest MMA fighter and his weaknesses were likely his stamina and his standup fighting abilities however his Superior wrestling skills and brutal fighting style enabled him to defeat several tough opponents potentially including someone as skilled as Steven Sagal although Sagal has extensive martial arts training and has trained prominent Fighters Lesnar's competitive experience in wrestling and MMA gives him an

To find the answer, we have to go all the\nway back to 1945. World War 2 has just ended and after winning\nthe war, the British want to spread English throughout the world. As you might already know, English is not\nexactly a very easy language to learn as a non-native speaker. So, they created this simplified version of\nEnglish called Basic English. Basic English had only 850 words. For comparison, there are around 170,000 total\nwords in English. In addition to fewer words, Basic English\nalso had simplified grammar rules, with a focus on basic sentence structures. To popularize the language, the British used\nstate owned radio called British Broadcasting Corporation or BBC to create a show named\n“English by Radio ''. This show taught Basic English vocabulary and pronunciation to non-native\nspeakers and was a huge success. But how could just 850 words and a few basic\ngrammar constructs help people learn English? And can we use the same principles to learn\na new programming language? To answer that, we need to know a few things\nabout how the languages exactly work. Imagine a circle that contains the top 10%\nmost popular words among the 170,000 total words in English. This circle would contain words like I, me,\nyou, eat, drink etc. Then we have another circle around it that\ncontains the next 20% most popular words. This would contain words like overpaid and\nprogrammer which makes sense. And we can keep making these circles until\nwe cover all 170,000 words. In case you are curious, the outermost circle\ncontains words like nincompoop and teetotaler. For simplicity, let’s combine the innermost\ntwo circles together and the rest of the circles together. Now imagine that you start reading one of\nthe best novels of our times called “Fifty Shades of Grey” which has a total of 150,000\nwords. What you’ll find is that roughly 80% of\nthese 150,000 words in the book lie in the inner circle and the rest of the 20% words\ncome from the outer circle. For those who don’t know, this is also known\nas Pareto principle. Pareto principle states that 20% of your effort\nresults in 80% of your outcomes. And this powerful principle is the main idea\nbehind the BASIC English as well as the secret to learning a new programming language really\nfast. I applied the same principle to learn French\nand now, “Je peux parler en français mais mon accent est marrant”. “Learning a new spoken language is one thing\nbut learning a language that a computer understands is totally different”, you might say. Well, let’s try to test this hypothesis. Let’s build the same circles for the vocabulary\nof programming languages. What would be the top 10% most popular concepts\nhere? I believe it would include different data\ntypes like int, float, strings or Array etc. Maybe “if else” blocks and for loops would\nalso be part of this circle. Maybe writing functions and classes would\nalso be here. If you move outside to the next circle, you\nmight have concepts like polymorphism and inheritance etc. And you can keep drawing these circles until\nyou reach the outermost circle that might have I don’t know, maybe iterators or generators. Now if you pick all the Github repos in the\nlanguage of your choice, you will find that 80% of the code would be coming from the inner\n20% circle. And following what we learnt from the BASIC\nEnglish example, we will focus on this 20% circle first. But as we do this, we need to be careful about\n2 things. Number one, this 20% circle though fairly\nsimilar might vary a little bit across different languages. For example, in Java, you might have an Arraylist\nand you will call it just List in Python. Or in Javascript, you might have async/await\nwhich might be very different in other languages. The point is, this top 20% circle might change\ndepending on the language you pick. So, you would want to do your own research\non the top concepts for the language of your choice. Number two, when you are trying to learn these\nconcepts, you need to change your method of learning. If you were trying to learn a new spoken language,\nlet’s French for example. No matter how many movies or TV series you\nwatch in French, you will not be able to speak French unless you actually try to talk in\nFrench. In the same way, no matter how many lectures\nor video tutorials you watch in Javascript, you will not be able to code in Javascript\nunless you actually try to code in Javascript. In a video tutorial, you will usually get\nthe code that already works and if you copy it, sure enough, it will work for you as well. But, programming is the art of breaking and\nfixing things. That’s why I recommend interactive learning\ninstead of casual learning. For example, if you want to learn Python,\nyou can go to learnpython.org and do exercises, break things and fix them as you learn new\nconcepts. Similarly, for Javascript, you can use W3\nschools. I am sure you can find this kind of platform\nin other languages as well. Now that you know what to learn and how to\nlearn it, there are 2 problems left for us to solve. How to remember what we are learning and How\nto learn the rest of 80% concepts in the circle. To solve the first problem, we need to first\nunderstand the Ebbinghaus Forgetting curve. Herman Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist\nwho is well known for his work on memory and learning. He conducted experiments where he would give\nhimself some nonsense words to remember and then test himself at various intervals to\nsee how many of these words he could remember. What he found became the backbone of how we\nteach kids in the modern school system. What you are seeing is the famous Ebbinghaus\nForgetting curve. This graph is a classical exponential decay\ngraph. What this means is that right after we learn\nsomething new, we start forgetting it very quickly. But this rate of forgetting slows down over\ntime and in the end, we only retain a small fraction of what we learnt. But what if I tell you that there is a way\nto retain more of what we learnt. Ebbinghaus also studied the impact of revision\non our retention. What he found was that if you review the concepts\nagain, you can increase the number of words you remember in the end. And if you repeat this multiple times, your\nretention can keep increasing. And this is called Spaced Repetition, which\nmany of you might have already heard about. This is the reason why if you try to learn\na new language using an app like Duolingo, they keep repeating the same words again and\nagain in the exercises. But how do we apply the spaced repetition\nto learning a new programming language? The answer to this question is also the answer\nto the second problem that we still need to solve. So, let’s quickly cover the second problem\nand then we will talk about the solution. The other pending problem we have is that\nwe have still not figured out how to learn the remaining 80% of concepts. For this, we need to take a breadth first\napproach to our learning. What this means is that instead of taking\nsome random long deep path from the inner circle to the outside boundary, we just keep\nenlarging our inner circle. In other words, we slowly keep increasing\nthe breadth of our knowledge. The biggest advantage of doing this is that\nwe are only learning new things that are close to what we already know and this makes learning\nthem very easy. But how exactly do we do this? To remember more of what we have learnt so\nfar and to learn the remaining 80% concepts, all we need to do is build projects. But not just any projects, we need projects\nwith increasing difficulty. I will tell you which exact projects to build\nin a moment. But, building projects helps you in 2 ways. Number one, as you build projects, you will\nencounter the top 20% concepts again and again. And this will help you achieve spaced repetition. Number two, as you build projects, you will\nneed to learn some new concepts on the go. If you choose your projects carefully and\nslowly increase the difficulty, you can constantly expand your inner circle to become the same\nsize as the outer circle. One thing that you should be aware of though\nis that you will never be able to learn 100% of what there is to learn. But look at you. You don’t know everything about the language\nthat you speak and you are doing just fine. So, don’t obsess over learning everything. As I mentioned, choosing the right projects\nis extremely important. Doing this will not only help you learn faster,\nit will provide you with a portfolio of projects that you can write on your resume to impress\nthe hiring managers. If you want to know about the 5 projects that\nI recommend to all beginners, you can watch this video.

believe me the ending is crazy so let's go 1 minute let's go okay so let's Del him let's go paint our little player dude oh yeah we could probably zoom in go like that go like boom Oh God boom that's his gun why does it look like a beak oh no yep okay he looks good yeah okay I can't okay uh if what the where where is it key it's w w change y s where's the S okay then we're going to duplicate this couple more times d and a that's at the top d i no that's like the right and then a come on oh that's not a Jesus come on dude dude oh my can I make him have a gun at least hello come on come on come on come on come on come on let's go come on okay I think we did it okay you can shut up I get it this is the one minute game yes it's a masterpiece wow look look at the gun look at the player he's quick as hell bro yeah he's shooting like air right now you probably can't tell it's like a ghost bullet they'll never see him coming uh yeah yeah next game so 24 hours let's begin all right so we can delete scratchy but I can't make the art in here I want it to be pixel art so now we're in a Sprite where we can make our pixel art and I'll be back when I'm finished so here we have our guy in our animation and I don't know about you but this guy looks kind of familiar yeah let's not worry about that too much so let's export it into scratch and now this is when he's facing the right so I'm going to do r r and I'll be back when I finish making the left and so now we have our animation here and our animation here I'm going to name them to player go back to the code and so now I can code the movement G I clicked forever if key space w then I'm going to make speex speed y for all VAR set both these guys to zero on begin and if W change y by we'll go like three and then right to click duplicate if S3 and I'm going to set yped to * 0.75 itself y speed and then just change y by y speed so now if we go up here and we press click Play Let me just put him to 0 0 real quick there we go we can see that it moves up and down really smoothly maybe a little bit too smooth I'll do like 0.6 and if we go like this boom perfect now I can just get rid of these and I'll copy the same thing for the horizont Al XP another to all down that we can go back here and wa that's cool we can got him moving around I think he's a little bit slow so I'll go like four 444 and to keep everything organized I'm going to make player speed and player friction I'm going to set player speed and I'm going to set player friction to 0.6 and four so if I do I can get rid of both of these player speed can go here player speed can go here and then I have to do a negative player speed because it's -4 and then put the friction in for this it's just so I can change the player speed and everything a little bit easier so now if I go back in here now he still works the same beautiful but what about the animations this is important this is what I'm going to be using here for the animation I'm going to change costume by one you'll see why that's going to be the speed of the animation and I can do when G A clicked forever if I'm going to grab the mouse X if Mouse X is greater then zero it's going to switch to costume it's going to start at one and then it's going to rotate down to two do I know what this all is no am I going to explain it no so if I do this he's on my right we can see that he plays the animation and it's really fast so I think I'll turn down to like 0.25 or I'll do like 0.1 beautiful so it's just going to cycle through 1 2 one 2 1 and if I do else so that means if it's on the left it's going to go to start at three and just mod two and so it's going to be working wherever your mouse is essentially cuz it's going to be a shooter type of game and so and so now I'm going to make a Crosshair this is our Crosshair file export we can drag that in here boom and we can send the 200 just like our character and when clicked forever go to Mouse pointer and now it's going to look like a little bit more sense if our characters look in this way cool but are you ready for this 3 2 1 boom this thing am I going to explain it no no I'm not but essentially it Smooths out the movement so it just looks a lot cleaner than before pretty cool and now I'm going to add a little detail of just rotating it now I think this looks really cool so let me just finish all the animations just like now we can see we have animations for every single thing I guess yeah pretty cool I it looks pretty good also made like different eyes so now they like look at me pretty cool now little bro looks happy let's go now we need to give him this gun which it would make sense for it to be white so let's make it white and so ready now we have this really cool looking gun and we can see it switched from side to side and it looks awesome yeah we can also see if I don't move it it goes up and down a little bit which is really nice good detail now we're just one more step closer to finishing the game which is the bullet so let's just do that real quick paint bullet zoom in all the way convert to bit map make a bullet yeah that looks like a bullet zoom out wait where the heck is the middle at oh there it is change it 200 name it bullet and whener clicked hide and forever if Mouse down then great a clone on myself wait 0.1 second I'm actually going to drag this into the gun get rid of that here here for a clone of bullet and then do move five steps you'll see why in a second go back to the bullet when I start as a clone also need to do forever hide and hide and remove the hide there and I can do goto gun repeat until touch an edge move 10 steps then delete itself and we got to make sure he shows so I think that is it and I think I should do point in Direction gun Direction I think that could be a good good add-on and so let's see how that works okay that's looking pretty good but I think I need to make it up a little bit cuz it's kind of off something like that now if I go back we can see that yep it looks perfect except for for the bottom one though I'm going to copy that and where do I move it do I move it up no I move it oh damn what the hell no I move it down like that I think that should be good perfect and so I'm going to do grab this in here change it to bullet bullet two I'm going to name it bullet R bullet L for right and left and then I can just put that in there beforehand and I can get rid of this so basically if the direction is less than zero on this side it's going to switch to the right bullet and if it's if it's not on the left side it's going to change to the right and so we could see that in action maybe we won't cuz it has to be Exposition right no it's not I'm actually dumb as hell oh maybe I'm not dumb I just had to change these two around my bad and so now we have this guy how cool doesn't this look super cool and now one of our last steps is to make the enemy so let's go do that so now that I have the Slime animations I Can Begin coding their AI so very simply since this is just a test I'm not going to make clown I'm going to do M Play Click go to 0 100 at the start and repeat until Point towards player wait a second I also have to start jump and then we're going to do push a jump two wait 0.1 seconds and instead of that I'm going to do next and I'm going to repeat that I believe six more times well I guess yeah six so let's just see what that looks like oh what the freak that rotation style to don't rotate so we can see this guy jumping towards us pretty simple in cool he almost looks like a rock yeah he's definitely just a rock so now I could just take all this do create clone to myself I don't know I could like repeat that like I don't know three times and then I could do when I start as a clone but I'm going have to do hide and then show and I could just do go to random position there we go we have our slimes that kind of look like a rock as we can see they're going to spawn randomly this is not the finished game trust me but yeah they look pretty cool and now I just created a shadow for the player which I think it adds like a pretty cool amount of detail damn this looks so cool oh my God but now I think we should add some damage and some HP for a player let me just quickly finish everything I need to do to finish the game let's go so I changed the enemy to green and I also made the start menu with the start button and the logo right after that I imported into scratch and it actually looks pretty good wow same with the enemies they look so sick I then worked on a score counter to see how many enemies you killed and I added a little bit of sound effects I then thought the game was getting kind of boring so I decided to had another gun that you could use to kill the enemies I first started off with a katana and then made a shotgun and I will say that these took forever and no the sword does not look the greatest animation but it's whatever I then had to model a background because I was long overdue and this took forever but it looks amazing and then I thought to myself well only having one enemy is kind of lame so I made this really big enemy and then this really small but fast enemy but that being said I only need a few things to polish up the game so I made a you died screen and I think we can call this game finished with me working on the project on and off

"script": "latest news on the Pharaoh's fighter jets in Africa the newest user of the Sukcoy Su35 Super Flanker has been identified iran rejects Super Flankers that were ready for delivery [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to our channel today's video focuses on breaking news about the newest official user of Russian Sukcoy fighter jets jets that were at times expected to be delivered to Iran but have now ended up in another country according to evidence the Pharaoh's super flankers which were originally meant for Egypt have ended up in the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria in this video we'll get familiar with the unfortunate fate of Egypt's Sukcoy SU35s and in contrast Algeria's ambition but the most important question is why didn't Iran go after this windfall wouldn't purchasing fighter jets that had been ready for years have been more logical especially under the current sensitive regional conditions or has Iran's plan for modernizing its airfleet changed altogether or perhaps there's another reason behind the scenes in other words a tangled web surrounding the SU35 mystery in Iran satellite images and videos posted online suggest that Algeria has suddenly emerged as a leading operator of the Su35 these jets have unexpectedly taken to the skies over the African continent since about a month ago with minimal media coverage but the main question here was how these jets suddenly appeared in Algeria in such a short time the answer lies with another African country the Arab Republic of Egypt a transcontinental nation with direct connections between Asia and Africa and of course the keyholder of the strategic Suez Canal in March 2019 reports emerged stating that Egypt intended to purchase over 24 Su35 fighter jets from Russia under a deal valued at approximately 2 to3 billion this agreement had been finalized in late 2018 and it was expected that deliveries would begin in 2020 or 2021 on the other hand the US Secretary of State at the time warned that if Egypt proceeded with the purchase sanctions would be imposed on the Egyptian government under the Katza law countering America's adversaries through sanctions act despite these statements Russia began producing the Su35s for Egypt in 2020 and the first five fighter jets were completed and flown that same year by 2021 a total of 17 jets had been manufactured for Egypt and it's likely that shortly afterward this number increased to between 22 and 30 however Arab newspapers suddenly reported that three countries Egypt Algeria and Indonesia had suspended their military contracts with Russia including deals for new fighter jets meanwhile the United States had approved the sale of a version of the F-15E fighter jet to the Egyptian Air Force with the Egyptian generals stepping back the Pharaoh's super flankers which were ready to fly over the deserts remained under snow and ice in the far east of Moscow at the Kamsumulsk on Amore aircraft plant one of the largest aviation industry complexes in the Russian Federation egypt's custom options and sometimes weaker equipment didn't appeal to the Russian Air Force or Navy so the best solution was to find another buyer and what better country than Iran at least from the perspective of the media and even Iranian sources Egypt's SU35s were an ideal option for Iran's exhausted air force at least 30 fighter jets that with the deepening of cooperation between the two countries over the past 5 years even before the October 7th operation and the True Promise operations could have been operational in the country there was hope for this even up until recent months but now suddenly these fighter jets have gone to Algeria satellite images show that the Sukcoy Su35s present in Russia have received the Roundell of the Algerian Air Force and have been loaded via Antonov 124 transport aircraft at the Kamolskamore facility and unloaded at the elbowagi air base the discussion of Algeria receiving Su35s jets has been circulating for years in 2016 reports were published stating that Algeria's military had tested this jet a Russian newspaper named Commerce later claimed in 2019 that Algeria had signed a contract for 14 SU35 fighter jets alongside other jets like the Sukoy SU34 and Sukoy Su57 although neither Russia nor Algeria ever officially confirmed it on the other hand with Algeria announcing a contract for the purchase of the Su57 Iran remained the only potential customer for this Egyptian squadron and it was never expected that the Super Flanker would return to Africa again but the story is a bit more complicated according to a photo published a few years ago during a visit by the Russian Minister of Defense to the United Aircraft Corporation facilities the Su35 production schedule becomes somewhat clear based on the chart visible on the monitor screen a total of 30 SU35 Superflanker jets were produced in two batches 22 and eight aircraft respectively in 2020 and 2021 which were most likely Egypt's order however there's also an unknown customer involved a country scheduled to receive 12 jets in 2022 14 in 2023 and 8 in 2024 whose name is still undisclosed so if we assume that this unknown customer was Iran it can be guessed that the fighter jet purchase agreement was signed almost simultaneously with Egypt's and repurchasing Egypt's customordered jets wouldn't have made sense but now in 2025 contrary to the promised production of jets for Iran starting from 2022 there's still no sign of them two factors likely played a role in this first the war in Ukraine which has occupied the capacities of Russian factories and along with European sanctions slowed down production second the pressure from the United States on Iran Russia relations but even if we say the unknown customer wasn't Iran then why weren't Egypt's Sukcoy SU35s purchased perhaps the strongest argument is that the downgrade of Egypt's customized fighter jets failed to win approval from the Iranian Air Force and Iran demanded a special version instead a topic that could be extensively discussed currently reports indicate that Algeria has purchased 14 of the 28 initially manufactured aircraft for Egypt however the exact role of the SU35 in Algeria's air force remains unclear it's not known whether these aircraft will expand Algeria's fleet or replace older units algeria's air force with its current fleet of Sukcoy Su30 MKAs and older MiG 29s has long relied on Soviet and Russian hardware the retirement of MIG 25 interceptors in 2022 created a significant gap for the country which was supposed to be filled by the purchase of 14 Su57s however by 2024 Russia had only about 12 Su57s in service full-scale production of the aircraft faced delays due to sanctions supply chain disruptions caused by the Ukraine war and technical challenges such as the unfinished Iselia 30 engine pushing back the export version's delivery therefore contrary to earlier expectations Algeria agreed to the immediate purchase of Egypt's SU35s in order to overcome geopolitical challenges regarding the Arab Sahara with Morocco however there are still a number of Egyptian super flankers with unnamed ownership and it remains to be seen whether they too will go to Algeria or meet a different fate from secret contracts to delayed deliveries the Su35 story just keeps unfolding if this kind of deep

something Monumental happened a day that marked the end of one type of economy and the start of another it is something that is slowly changing the world economy but behind closed doors and it's something that large financial institutions don't want you to know about so what is this thing well let's step back to the 1980s big hair cocaine Michael Douglas yelling greed is good back then institutions trading huge amounts of stock needed a way to do it quietly so in 1986 a company called instanet created something called the first dark pool of money so just to quickly explain what really dark poool money is it goes something like this dark pools are private hidden stock markets where big players Banks hedge funds billionaires and many others in the elite club trade huge amounts of stock without the public ever seeing it it's like wall Street's VIP section where the Real Deals actually happen and US regular people are stuck outside like losers at the club not that that's ever happened to me it was like an underground poker game but for stocks no lights no cameras just trades happening in total secrecy at first it was a niche thing Banks and hedge funds used it to swap stocks like they were exchanging bags of cash in a parking garage but then the government stepped in in 1998 the US Securities and Exchange committee Mission or the SEC introduced regulation ATS which is alternative trading systems this was supposed to give investors more options to trade outside of traditional exchanges but as always Wall Street found a way to turn this into a money printing loophole by the early 2000s more dark pools of secret trades popped up and big Banks realized wait if we control dark pools we can control who gets the best prices without anyone knowing dark pools were supposed to be a way for big investors to trade large amounts of stock without screwing up prices because if a hedge fund needs 5 million shares of I don't know apple on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ the second people see that order Panic sets in and prices tank and well that's bad for the seller so they said let's just do these big trades you know in secret and that's how dark pools were born no price impact no public record just billionaire handshakes behind a velvet curtain but in 2005 comes regulation nms which stands for National Market System which was a well-meaning but completely naive SEC rule it was supposed to make sure investors got the best price available no matter where a trade happened and it sounds great right well it wasn't instead Banks realized they don't have to use public exchanges at all they can match trades in secret as long as the price is close to the public public one and they can do all of this in dark pools away from watchful eyes now between 2005 in 2012 dark poool trading exploded from 3% to 40% of all stock trades and by 20125 in fact by last week the Monumental day the majority of all trades is now dark pool but now as of 2025 in fact as of last week more than half of all trades on the stock market are dark poool money trades meaning that half of stock trading is now invisible to millions of people that trade on the stock market it's not happening on the New York Stock Exchange not the NASDAQ it's happening in private Market owned by Wall Street itself so now that the billionaires and the dark pools officially run the majority of the investing world let's break down what this actually means for us peasants when you check a stock price you think oh this is what people are paying for it nope that's just what the little guys are paying for it the real price now is set in dark pools where billionares and hedge funds make their deals in secret imagine if Amazon had a second private website where only rich people got special discounts and you weren't allowed to see it that's what dark pools are doing for stocks so if now more than half of all trades are off exchange how do you know if the price you're paying for it is fair well you don't and it probably isn't fair because B investors get first dibs on price movements in fact your trades that you might make on something like Robin Hood they go through market makers like Citadel who profit off of your trade you never directly invest into the stock market ever even if you make trades through your bank there's always some third party that's in the way and so if all of this sounds bad to you well it kind of is and has been in 2014 Barclays ran a dark pool called LX which they marketed as safe investment for highfrequency Traders except oops they were secretly letting hfts Feast on everyone else's trades when New York's attorney general found out Barclays got hit with $70 million in fines but fun fact they made way more money than that from the scheme so naturally they just kept doing it a little bit before that on May 6th 2010 the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 1,000 points in just a few minutes and one of the best examples of dark poool trading actually came during the GameStop frenzy of 2021 where actually 80% of gme or GameStop trades were happening off Exchange in dark pools retail investors were wondering why isn't the stock moving higher when everyone is buying it well that was because most of the trades were being internalized in dark pools and market makers like Citadel they weren't letting the orders move the price on public exchanges but these are just a few examples of how dark pools are directly affecting some of the trades that you make but now I want to ponder how bad could this all get I mean dark pools were just a small fraction of the stock market just 40 years ago and now they are the majority of Trades so let's set up the worst case scenario what if dark pools keep growing until they completely take over the market we're already at 50% of Trades happening in secret and some Wall Street insiders think by 2030 it could be 80% if that happens stock exchanges will become just the place where small investors trade while big money operates in its own private system the stock price you see will just be completely fabricated the trades you place are priced in after all of the billionaires and all of the financial institutions already have made their decisions and all of a sudden it's not just average everyday investors that are left out of the market it's millionaires or even multi-millionaires they're getting left out now too in this scenario and this is not just conspiracy talk because it's already happening so anyways in this first scenario where 80% of trading is dark the stock market just becomes a theme park for retail investors in Wall Street bets the actual market and the real money it moves in private and we'll never see it but another potential path and scenario is the liquidity death spiral so what happens when so much trading happens in dark pools that the public markets can't even set real prices anymore so right now dark pool's piggyback off of stock exchanges they match trades based on public prices but if too much trading moves to the dark side well then public stock prices become unreliable so in this scenario large gigantic price swings become pretty realistic because there aren't those big public orders to stabilize prices instead of a stock having a down day of 1 or 2% all of a sudden the average down or update could be 5 or 10% or more in this scenario Market crashes would also be worse flash crashes would happen all of the time just like they did in 2010 for one day except they would happen many times per year all of a sudden the highfrequency Traders and the algorithm Traders well they now have to deal with the giant price fluctuations and their algorithms well that they might not do too well in uh in this kind of scenario either meanwhile a lot of those you know midlevel hundred million institutions well they would struggle during this as well and they could go under and all of their money would go to the large financial institutions that would buy them out but now another thing that could hopefully happen is well the SEC grows a spine but this is pretty unlikely you see the SEC has been talking about dark pool money for years but they haven't done anything they could require big institutions to execute a certain amount of their trades publicly preventing them from permanently hiding in dark pools Europe already does this by the way the EU caps dark trading at 8% per stock the us could do the same but Wall Street lobbyists would fight it harder than a toddler fights at bedtime so what should you take from all this well when you see a stock price it's probably fake now and it's going to get more fake into the future the large hundred billion dollar or trillion dollar institutions well they get to make a lot more money now so that's great good for them they will make all of this money in private we won't see any of it if a large group of Traders trade through apps now as we know it doesn't really matter big market makers control everything now and the stock market is becoming more and more of a fake game where billionaires play in private and Retail invest ERS trade into a rigged system but what do you think of all this what do you think about dark poool money where do you see it going and do you think that this is a major problem in the United States and in the world right now let me know in the comments down below see you", "duration(in seconds)": 584.0, "region": "US"}}

one of her uh what would you say teammates from her wrestling from her pro wrestling area yeah and just pounded her so they have a little be they have a little something going on there in between each other as you saw in the video there all right we're going to be starting our ninth bout one match ryen MMA rules women's rules I want to see uh I want to see maybe throw some hands no she says she was improving on the Striking there it is nice jab there by o both of them oh get her get her you know I mean that's respect between fires but really you don't know if that was you don't know if that was a poke or a punch you just got to go after him finger in the ey she's handing I'd like to see a replay I think they are going to show they're not used to yeah they're not used to she's not used to boxing with open hand gloves oh yeah it is a finger it is a finger nice little scrape not too bad though that can change the fight yeah it can that can change fight she gets five minutes to recover from this now if say the fight could continue I believe it would be a no contest because the fight has only gone so long MH now she's saying that uh she intentionally went over poked her in the eye but it looked like it more was she was throwing a kick a lot of times you kick with your hand open uh I don't think it yeah I think she's good to go yeah she's okay you're fine keep fighting yeah was oh yeah that's not intentional yep Bang Bon yeah finger in the eye there you know I had that happen to me and I had to get surgery the next day really yeah I got poked twice in one of my fights um the fight couldn't continue it was like the second round and I had to have eye surgery the next day they had to uh close up one of my um my tear Ducks really it was torn completely yep and now you know I can't cry out of that eye but luck luckily you know if I could cry my tears would cure cancer wait I think I've read that somewhere like a Chuck nor that was good though that was good they're still talking about it no matter what I mean CU I've been in this situation I should have finish the fight when when it happened to me uh you know you got to be able to go in there and fight with one eye it it's just it's just a part of the fight you don't want to go out like this you did all that work you can still go out Chu and throw who cares close that eye keep that right hand up and go to town let's see what happens here my thoughts that's what I would do um well it looks like she's saying she can't see the guy fing the doctor's fing who cares it's a fight it's a fight and this this is a terrible way to go out yeah it is I've done this I I was winning a fight uh it went to the second round I got poked in the first I got poked in a second and I I literally couldn't see out of that eye it was blurry it was like a bloodshot you know the finger went all the way in and tore my tear duct um and in my in my head now M I should have stayed in the fight I should have kept fighting I should have did what I had to do to stay in she's not happy you know there's there's nothing that they can do this happens your open hand uh strikes if she can't continue right now you know that's so what will happen if she actually forfeits from this I mean it's a it is an illegal move but it was an accident that's what I'm saying that's why I'm saying if it was on purpose then I could see you know get taking the fight away but it would be a no contest I believe in my in my mind it would be a no contest because it was accidental and it was so it was still in the first round I want to say if it went to the second round and it happened like this and they had to stop it it would go to the judge's card that's probably where it's going right now I think they're the fight announcement [Music] made so they're saying that she can't continue the fight and it was no contest no contest no contest that and they're saying it was an accident this is not a way to go out it yeah it's an accident it's an accident uh you know this is her first time in the ring she's never experienced this I think you know you know she's saying it's gloves it's not on purpose it's not on purpose she didn't purposely uh poke her in the eye uh I could see a rematch for sure MH next card or whenever but unfortunately sometimes surprise Condor surpris unfortunately sometimes this happens you know yep you know and Gabby's parents her family is here they probably wanted to watch it fight oh yeah now as far as MoneyWise I believe because they made weight mhm they'll get at least the fight Pur they if they if their contract deemed a win bonus they won't get the win bonus but but on the other hand too I know you know I understand that she's from a more of a boxing has a boxing career and they use cloes gloves but I mean yeah she could have still went I think I don't know depending on mean she's the fighter she's the only one that really knows but in my uh in you know in my career I went through the same thing I should have stuck it out I couldn't see I like I said I had to have surgery the next day but you're in the fight you might as well finish it you know you got to make do with what you got put that hand up cover the head where you can't see and just go forward and and uh try to finish the fight um you know if I was her I would have just stepped back say yeah let's fight and then try to kick her in the head there it goes that would actually fix everything all right we're going to go into our next bout it was a no contest by Gabby got I want to see Gabby throw some hands she said is improving on the St there it is nice jab there by aland oh get her get her you know I mean that's respect between Fighters but really you don't know if that you don't know if that was a pop or punch you's got to go after finger in the eyes I'd like to see a replay I think they are going to show they're not used to yeah they're not used to uh she's not used to boxing with open hand gloves oh yeah it is a nice little scrape not too bad though that can change the fight yeah I can get minutes now if the fight could continue I believe it would be no cont the so long [Music]",

Financial Literacy for Kids provides the basics about needs versus wants, budgeting, credit versus debit, and more. The points are easy to follow and understand. By the end, students will receive a good foundation of these points of financial literacy.\n\nA need is something that is necessary to survival. Food, water, and shelter are needs because we need those things to survive. Wants include much more, from toys and books to phones and cars. While it can be difficult to tell the difference sometimes, these definitions will help you find the answer. \n\nThe video also reviews the concepts of saving versus borrowing. Saving money is something we do so that we can eventually buy something we want, like a new bike. This can take time. If you want something more immediately, you can borrow money. Borrowing money, however, means that you have to pay back the money you borrowed over time. And sometimes you have to pay interest.\n\nBudgeting is a very helpful tool to help control or manage our finances. A budget designates a certain amount of money to go toward certain things. For instance, perhaps you budget $50 for food for a week. If you spend more money on food than you budgeted for that week, you may have to save money somewhere else to ensure you don't spend more money than you have and go into debt.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

this giant fighter stands at a towering 7'2 in and weighs an incredible 351 lb in comparison The Shaolin monk Yong is just 5'9 in tall and weighs 176 lb mathematically speaking it seems almost almost impossible for Yong to win against Choy Hong man even so Yong appears confident in his abilities especially given that this Shaolin monk is trained in several martial arts including kickboxing and wooo went out for a second but he just writes and says give me your best shot and he has plenty of them still he comes Yong also has an impressive track record in martial arts having competed in several tournaments across multiple weight classes super welterweight welterweight and super middleweight not to mention the numerous Awards Yong has achieved throughout his martial arts career he's claimed titles such as wuin Fun World Champion in 2013 wck World Champion in 2015 S1 super middleweight Muay Thai world champion in 20 2014 wuin Fang World Champion in 2014 and cik World Champion in 2012 with this wealth of experience it's clear that Yong feels confident enough to challenge a giant fighter unbelievable you would not believe that if somebody told you however let's not underestimate Cho Hong man it's not just his massive physique that will pose a challenge for Yong in the ring it's also his extensive experience in various championships throughout his career his track record shows why Choy Hong man is recognized as a South Korean kickboxer a mixed martial artist and a former scum wrestler on top of that several accolades mark his success in the ring underscoring why this giant fighter should not be overlooked from winning the prestigious K1 World Grand Prix kickboxing event in Soul in 2005 to reaching the semi-finals in the dream super Hulk tournament in 2009 Choy hongman has proven himself time and again so with each Fighter's background who will emerge Victorious will it be the Shaolin monk or the giant fighter let's watch A Match that will keep you on the edge of your seat as the 9-minute match begins Choy hongman immediately unleashes his full strength and skill to attack Yong leaving the Shaolin monk on the defensive with no room for counterattacks however yong's determination to win isn't shaken by this assault in fact it seems to fuel his Spirit making him even more eager to strike back one crucial move for Yong though is to keep a safe distance if choong man manages to get a hold of him it could spell disaster for yong's career and life yet it appears that Yong has trained diligently and devised a smart strategy to defeat the giant fighter moments later Yong successfully lands several punches directly on Cho Hong man's face but yong's attack only seems to fuel the giant Fighter's rage Cho Hong man responds by increasing his pressure closing in on the Shaolin monk relentlessly but with the Fearless mindset of a Shaolin monk ye long continues to fight back despite the challenge of targeting Choy Hong man's head the tension in the room mounts as the two fighters exchange blows and not a single spectator wants to leave their seat the energy is electric as the crowd watches this intense Showdown occasionally Yong ramps up the pressure by combining punches with kicks scoring points for his efforts unfortunately though many of the Shaolin Monks attacks don't seem to phase his opponent in fact each strike from Yong only appears to add to choong man's pressure on him could it be that the Shaolin monk is on the verge of defeat even so yong's Spirit remains unbroken The Shaolin monk stays determined in his limited but persistent attacks a tactic to fend off Choy Hong man's powerful blows any of which could potentially knock ye long out in an [Music] instant Yong even manages to land a few strikes to the giant Fighters Temple a feat considering the height difference between them finally a spinning kick from Yong hits his opponent causing Cho Hong man such pain that the referee has to pause the match Choy hongman is clearly in pain clutching his sensitive area did yong's kick really land in a vital area let's watch the replay together you can see how yong's kick connects with his opponent's body and it appears that his foot did not actually strike Choy Hong man vital area do you think the same the referee continues attempting to help Choy hongman get back into the fight but it's not so simple the giant fighter seems to be in serious pain on the edge of the Ring the referee asks Choy Hong man again if he's able to continue the [Music] fight however still reeling from the impact of yong's kick Choy Hong man decides not to go on as a result Yong emerges as the winner this match was undoubtedly full of surprises leaving the audience in awe yong's Victory came from a single decisive strike to Choy hongman a fight that everyone thought the giant fighter had a chance to win [Music] [Music] [Music] spee for", "duration(in seconds)": 489.0, "region": "US"}}

economy, recession, inflation, about that, andrew chang, lauren bird, cbc news", "script": "when President Donald Trump won the election in November the market skyrocketed all right stock markets surge on the news of Mr Trump's Victory 1,500 points for the Dow today the Dow actually hit a new record high the overwhelming sentiment from investors was that this Administration would be good for business good for the economy it's what Trump campaigned on inflation will be in full Retreat our economy will be roaring back now not even two months into his presidency the talk of a possible American recession seems to be everywhere the RW recession wasn't even in the vocabulary a few weeks ago and Trump didn't rule out the possibility of a recession in a recent interview are you expecting a recession this year um I hate to predict things like that there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big that makes it sound like he's willing to trade a potential recession for the values and the goals that he has for the United States so how did the world's largest economy go from booming to stoking fears of a recession in just a few weeks let's start with the one place everyone is watching like a hawk if you want a real time indication of where things are at with the economy one place you can look is the stock market it is the right now the one thing that is signaling sort of a red light in terms of recession now we should make it clear the US is not in a recession and most experts aren't suggesting one is imminent either but that red light we just heard about it's a huge shift and it may not be surprising if you've been paying attention to the stock market which has cratered in the last few weeks wiping out all those gains from Trump's election and more breaking news from Wall Street right now the markets just closed clocking in their worst day of the year today was the worst day for the NASDAQ since 2022 take a look at the major indexes over the past month the S&P 500 lost almost 10% of its value the Dow Jones down nearly 9% the NASDAQ down about 133% more than 4 trillion dollar of market value has been lost in under a month technically the bull market that ostensibly began back in late October of 2022 that bull market is over this is the biggest bout of Market volatility in years and a lot of people uh you know not wanting to check their 401ks their retirement accounts of course because of this huge dip and a lot of it has to do with how investors are feeling about where the economy could be headed the stock market is not the economy but it does indicate people's moods about and prospects for companies because the stock market is forward-looking in the sense that people are expecting stock returns dividends those sorts of things I do think the stock market is a bit of a self-filling prophecy for the economy and that if people see the stock market down it overall lowers confidence and you can understand understand where that low confidence is coming from just think about the Whiplash we've seen over the last month president Trump announced sweeping tariffs president Trump's tariffs against Canada will now be put on hold Donald Trump's tariffs are in effect be clear for the 50% is that going to go into effect on Canada or not which one the 50% tariffs I'll let you know about it the chaos has been hard to keep up with and all of that uncertainty is making it tough for investors to know where to put their money leading to those huge sell-offs every time Trump announces tariffs if he thinks it's good for the American economy and good for American Business you should expect stocks to spike instead they creat it so he keeps announcing it and then backing off and announcing it and then backing off most recently markets have been like I don't know what the hell is going on I don't know how anyone can make any decisions and all of that uncertainty is showing in another place gold it's often considered an investment Safe Haven and turbulent Economic Times and its price has increased 11% since the start of the year so I think this sort of shock and awe campaign is definitely digging into the um into the psyche of Americans and uh you know naturally one can expect that people might go towards the safe havens there's some pretty unprecedented policies being pouted and that um has everybody uncertain and I think uncertainty is the big factor here and you can imagine Trump's comments about being in a period of transition doesn't temper those fears or that uncertainty he's even gone so so far is to say he's not actually concerned about it when it comes to decision- making some of these exemptions that have been announced and some of these temporary delays have you been influence in those decisions because of the market reaction no nothing to do with the market I'm not even looking at the market I do think that the Trump administration's thinking is that the stock market's going to go through a little bit of a blip and eventually investment will flow into the us as they plan with these tariffs and it'll be gangbusters again I think uh other folks are wondering if this is going to just be a deeper and deeper and that the stock market will sort of take the economy down with it and the fear now for economists is that the uncertainty that's rocking the stock market will trickle down through the rest of the economy it makes investors businesses consumers all verely nervous economists track a lot of indicators to get a sense of the economy things like jobs numbers GDP inflation retail sales and consumer sentiment a lot of that data lags a month or two behind so it's hard to say say exactly where the economy is right now but there are a couple of warning signs starting to show they're more yellow flags than red flags for the US economy but they are out there and they're part of the discussion take consumer sentiment which basically measures how people feel about the economy and their own financial situation the University of Michigan's tracker shows sentiment fell in January after Rising for five straight months and his report from last month said people's long-term expectations when it came to inflation exhibited sub substantial uncertainty especially concerning policy changes under the new presidential Administration we just keep going back to this word um uncertainty I think consumers are starting to wonder how these tariffs will play out it's part of an everyday discussion they're very much aware that import prices could increase what we are seeing actually is that households are not only unhappy about the General State of things in Washington they are starting to worry about their own economic situations and a fallen consumer sentiment could be a uniquely big problem for the us because consumption plays a huge role in the American economy 70% of its GDP comes from consumer spending that's high so people going out and buying cars food clothes it matters consumer sentiment is actually really important in thinking about the near future of the economy because if consumers are worried about their situations then they tend to pull back on spending and it doesn't take long for that to affect businesses it may already be happening the Delta Airlines warn it expects profits to be lower than previously indicated because of a Slowdown in both business and consumer spending and travel coals and Dick Sporting Goods adding to the flood of companies raising concerns about the US consumer and it's not just the big corporations the national Federation of Independent Business tracks small business optimism in February its uncertainty index Rose to 104 the second highest recorded reading and it showed only 15% of businesses after adjusting for normal seasonal changes plan to create new jobs in the next 3 months businesses are reacting to this uncertainty with what they usually do is namely become very conservative about their spending and their investing habits if you were a CEO right now and you had major investment projects in front of you you might just think to yourself I might just wait it out for a few months and see where all this lands and that's where the problems start to feed each other if businesses pull back on investing that could mean fewer new jobs maybe even job losses which may mean consumers don't feel safe to spend now if CEOs do this and families do this and we all do this then spending plummets and if that's the case that's the first step that causes a recession now again the US is not there that's the good news but as we've said how people feel about this really matters recessions can be self-fulfilling prophecies and according to the analysts we spoke to the uncertainty around all of this doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 527.0, "region": "US"}}

Trump on March 21st 2025 President Donald Trump dropped yet another information bomb by announcing that Boeing had won the contract to develop the sixth generation F-47 fighter jet this news instantly sparked widespread debate as the competition for the contract involved major defense industry players including Loheed Martin the traditional manufacturer of American fighter aircraft what makes the F-47 so important for the US Air Force what are its key features in this video we'll break down the technical characteristics and strategic implications of the new combat aircraft that could potentially reshape the balance of air power in the 21st century the F-47 is being developed under the next generation air dominance program or NGAD for short an ambitious US Air Force initiative aimed at creating a sixthg generation fighter jet capable of securing total air superiority in the high-tech conflicts of the future the ENGAD program is expected to replace the current fleet of F-22 Raptors which despite their power are becoming outdated in light of emerging threats from China and Russia before diving into the F-47 itself it's worth unpacking the intrigue behind the aircraft particularly the choice of Boeing as the developer considering the company's troubled reputation in recent years this might seem like a surprising decision however it appears to be the only realistic option at this point northre Grumman declined to participate in the ENGAD program opting instead to focus its efforts on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber loheed Martin another potential contender is committed for decades ahead to the production servicing and upgrading of the F-35 Lightning 2 multi-roll fighters in addition Loheed Martin's already involved in a separate program to develop a sixth generation carrierbased fighter for the US Navy that naval project is distinct from ENGAD as the Pentagon learned its lesson after the F-35 a joint project for both the Air Force and Navy proved to be far from ideal meanwhile Boeing which is already scaling back production of legacy models like the F-15 F-16 and FA18 has significant unused industrial and technological capacity the company simply too vital to the US defense sector to be left without contracts which would risk the loss of critical expertise moreover the recent scandals surrounding Boeing have led to massive internal reforms the new management is clamped down on the so-called efficient management practices putting real manufacturing back at the center of operations as for the F-47 itself solid information is still limited to key concepts this will be a heavyweight air superiority fighter positioned as a next generation replacement for the aging F-22 Raptor the primary design focus is long range capability essential for operations in the Indo-Pacific region clearly signaling where US strategic priorities are headed in the 2030s the aircraft is expected to feature low observability and a large payload capacity interestingly extreme maneuverability no longer appears to be a top priority seems the Pentagon has doubled down on the F-35's design philosophy where the aircraft might fly more like a penguin than an eagle but remains stealthy and deadly at long range in fact the F-47's main role likely won't be engaging in dog fights but rather serving as a sensor hub coordinating the actions of forward operating drones guiding surfaceto-air missiles and directing air-to-air missile strikes the aircraft is expected to be capable of sustained supersonic cruising at speeds up to Mach 2 and to reach an altitude comparable to or exceeding that of the F-22 a major focus of the program is adaptability meaning the F-47 must be easy to upgrade over time as battlefield requirements evolve both in terms of onboard equipment and software the F-47 will be powered by two next generation engines developed under the next generation adaptive propulsion program or NGAP created specifically for the ENGAD aircraft in August 2022 the US Air Force awarded framework contracts worth $975 million each to five leading American aerospace companies to design and test prototype NGAP engines these companies include GE Aerospace a division of General Electric Pratt and Whitney in partnership with Rathon Technologies Boeing Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman the last three are serving more as integrators than engine developers and the final engine choice is expected to be between two adaptive three stream concepts the XA 102 from GE Aerospace and the XA 103 from Prattton Whitney in early 2025 the Air Force expanded the contracts with GE Aerospace and Prattton Whitney to $3.5 billion each to support continued development and testing of their respective endgap engines interestingly the Chinese sixth generation fighter prototype known as the Changdu J36 reportedly uses three WS10C engines with afterburners this suggests that China has yet to achieve the required thrust levels in both dry and after burning modes and is compensating by installing three engines an arrangement that brings many obvious drawbacks in terms of appearance our only reference points are a few official composite images revealed in the Oval Office during Trump's announcement of Boeing's victory these show a fighter with a large cockpit canopy and a sharply swept wing with a pronounced dihedral angle it remains unclear whether the aircraft has vertical stabilizers but it likely does not as seen with China's Changdu J36 vertical stabilizers greatly compromise stealth and the F-47 is expected to be even less visible on radar than the already stealthy F-22 and F-35 true removing vertical stabilizers makes it more difficult to achieve aerodynamic stability and maneuverability but China's apparently managed it and the United States after all is the only country to have mass-produced tailless stealth bombers namely the B2 and B-21 the total cost of the ENGAD program is estimated at 20 billion the plan is to produce a fleet of 200 aircraft with the maximum unit cost including R&D reaching up to $300 million however the F-47 is projected to be cheaper to operate than the F-22 due to maturing technologies and a significant reduction in maintenance hours according to US Air Force Chief of Staff General David Alvin F-47 prototypes will take to the skies during the current Trump administration meaning before early 2029 it's also been revealed that since 2020 competing ENGAD teams have already built and flown several experimental demonstrator aircraft logging hundreds of flight hours during testing notably the Pentagon's vision of a sixth generation fighter appears to closely mirror that of China when China showcased three different sixth generation prototypes at the end of 2024 it sent shock waves through the US Air Force and was a major factor in reviving the ENGAD program which was on the verge of cancellation for the first time in decades American technological superiority and military aviation was seriously called into question trump's announcement appears aimed at restoring confidence in the US defense industry following the reputational blow caused by China's display of progress that may be why the president stated that the F-47 prototype had been undergoing secret testing for nearly 5 years unofficial sources claimed that experimental sixth generation aircraft have been flying since 2020 at classified locations including Edwards Air Force Base and the infamous Area 51 long associated with cuttingedge stealth technology and finally a small conspiracy theory why the F-47 designation originally the final contractor selection for this aircraft was scheduled for 2024 however between May and July 2024 President Joe Biden's administration effectively paused the program to re-evaluate its design concepts the ENGAD program was only restarted in late December 2024 likely influenced by the reelection of President Trump who had consistently supported the project during his first term in fact the ENGAD program saw some of its most important developments in 2018 and 2020 ultimately it was Trump who approved Boeing's proposal as the winner of the competition and here's the fun part trump is the 47th president of the United States put two and two together and the F-47 designation starts to look more symbolic than random there is however a more official explanation the F-47 name may be a nod to the legendary P47 Thunderbolt of World War II a heavy fighter that was one of the most powerful and effective aircraft of its time known for its ruggedness firepower and long range it played a key role in Europe especially against German forces and laid the foundation for the modern concept of the multi-roll heavy fighter so which version do you prefer could the F-47 eventually be named the Thunderbolt 3 don't forget the A-10 Thunderbolt 2 ground attack aircraft is already a living legend we hope that one day the F-47 earns that same iconic status and it certainly has all the ingredients to do so what do you think will the F-47 become a legend in its own right and more importantly will it outperform China's sixth generation Changdu J36 proving once again that the United States remains the global leader in military aviation especially in the realm of fighter aircraft share your thoughts in the

It gives me zero pleasure to \nhave to report to you today that the Trump economy   is collapsing before our eyes and the numbers \ndon't lie. Wall Street is in a freefall. Layoffs   are starting to surge. Consumer confidence has \ncratered. Inflation has ticked back up. Yet again,   as I record this, the Dow is down. another 400 \npoints. Even Donald Trump's favorite metric is   I'm talking about the stock market is looking \nlike a slow motion train wreck. And the kicker   is that it's because of Trump and it's because \nof Elon Musk. Yesterday, Monday saw one of the   worst stock market drops in a long time. The Dow \nat one point was down a thousand points. This is   after being down. 700 points the day before, \nyou know, weekend last week, the Nasdaq tanked   four point two percent, its biggest single day \ndecline since 2022. The S &P 500 broke below   what's considered a critical support level for \nthe first time in two years. And even the mega   corporations that Trump once paraded as signs of \na strong economy, they're not doing well. led by   Tim Apple, Mike. That's a joke. Microsoft, \nAlphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Metta, plunging   Tesla down 15 percent in a single day. We'll talk \nmore about Tesla in a moment. These are some of   the biggest drops in years, wiping out hundreds \nof billions of dollars of market value and why   Trump's economic chaos. The tariff obsession \nis here and it is back and it is staying and   the damage is showing the threats to Canada, to \nMexico, to China. They have investors panicking.   Businesses can't plan. Prices are rising. \nUncertainty is dragging down this economy. And   even JP Morgan Chase is now warning that there's a \n40 percent chance of a recession this year because   of Donald Trump's policies. If we zoom out a \nlittle bit and we think about. leads to stability,   predictability leads to stability. Companies rely \non stability when saying how many people do we   want working for us? Can we give raises \nthis year? Do we buy more inventory? And   what we're seeing is Trump treating the global \neconomy kind of like a reality show cliffhanger,   which I believe he thinks he's going to be able to \nsave and take credit for at the last second. But   it is costing Americans their savings and their \nbudgets. You know, Trump loves talking about   bringing jobs back, but it's not working. Federal \njob losses are piling up as Doge continues to say,   we don't need these people and we don't need \nthese people and we don't need those people.   Private sector layoffs hit their highest numbers \nin February, going all the way back to the Great   Recession of 2008. The latest jobs report very \nmuch weaker than expected. About half of the   expected jobs were created. Unemployment ticking \nup. And now we are seeing the real impact of   Donald Trump's anti -immigration agenda as well, \nbecause you see industries like construction, like   agriculture, even in health care, they are running \nout of workers. And without workers, businesses   cannot function, At least for now, we'll see what \nAI and robotics do in the future. Tesla. Once the   darling of Wall Street, now the poster child for \nTrump's economic disaster, consider the 180 that   has happened here. The stock losing more than \nhalf its value since December sales tanking,   investors fleeing. I fled a while ago, as many of \nyou know, Trump's trade war, making it worse and   even worse is that Tesla's brand is collapsing \nand not just because of Donald Trump's tariffs,   Musk has tied himself. to the sinking ship of \nDonald Trump and consumers are running for the   exits. Tesla stores are getting vandalized. \nLongtime customers like myself abandoning the   company. As many of you know, I had a Model 3 \nand then a Model Y. And I was a Tesla investor   because I thought this is the company moving \nforward. Electric vehicle battery technology,   the fastest I want to be part of it. Then Elon \nMusk went nuts. And the car build quality was   really not great. And I got out, as many of \nyou know, with a 1200 and 1600 percent gain.   And the Tesla fan boy said, David, this is the \nbiggest mistake you'll ever make. You'll regret   this. Well, I'm not regretting it. And Evie sales \nglobally are still going up, but Tesla's market   share is going down. We'll talk more about \nTesla when confronted with this reality, with   this economic mess that is surfacing, Trump says, \nwell, We're going to have a period of adjustment.   We're going to be in a transition period, which is \ntranslation for things are going to get much worse   before they get better. And Trump is admitting \nthat his economic policies are hurting Americans.   Wall Street sees right through it and they're \nrunning for cover. Trump inherited a perfectly   reasonable economy. We are now on the verge of \ntotal collapse. layoffs up. inflation ticking   up consumer confidence and consumer spending \ndown stock market in freefall recession odds,   the highest they've been in a long time. Trump's \nresponse is more chaos and more bluster and more   disoriented confusion, which you know, disoriented \nconfusion could be a band name or it could be the   motto of Donald Trump's political career. This is \nhis mess. And I'm thinking... How bad does it have   to get before it gets better? Let's now talk not \nabout Trump, but about co -president Elon Musk.", "duration(in seconds)": 480.0, "region": "US"}}

And the reality is talking in front of a microphone in. >> The 202. >> Area code is a lot different than the reality of moving the supply chain. And I think it speaks to our point that when you look at China. Exposed names from. Nvidia to Apple to any of the semi names, I mean, this this is as. Nervous as I've seen investors going back to, you know, Covid March 2020. >> So what. >> Do investors need to listen for on these earnings calls? What are the fundamental numbers to watch perhaps when it comes to margins getting squeezed. To understand what the real dynamics are going to be throughout the rest of 25, and where you can continue to get a valuation premium. >> So I think. >> There's three things. >> I think. >> You have to look at one. >> I mean, Navarro talked on negotiations. >> You have. >> To assume that these tariffs don't hold in their current form. If they hold in their current form that then essentially you have 15 to 20% demand destruction across the board in terms of cost that are actually going to have to come through. And then to that point, I don't think a lot of companies even give guidance on their one Q conference calls given, you know, what we've seen in terms of the head scratching tariffs? The thing that you really have to focus on in terms like what demand destruction looks like in terms of when it comes to AI revolution, data center, build out inventory. And then of course, you start looking at consumer focus names like Apple. In terms of what that means for iPhones. The reality. >> Is. >> If you want if you want an iPhone made in the US and you want that for $3,500, we should make in the US, if you want it for $1,000, you keep it in China. So I think that's these are all the issues that investors are trying to sort of game out. >> So in light of that, I'll just use Apple as an example. There's just this automatic assumption that any kind of price increase tied to 54% tariffs on goods imported that have been made in China, iPhones perhaps included in that is going to be pushed out to consumers. Is that is that actually going to be the case, especially if you look at an Apple that has pretty robust margins and maybe is going to absorb some of that cost? >> Yeah. Mark. >> If it was. >> A smaller tariff, that's something maybe that they can absorb. But these are numbers I mean that that are I view as absurd. And I think many of you across tech. So there's only whoever's going to pay it. It's the consumer. And that's the reality. You get to buy tariffs all you want. Consumers are going to pay it on iPhones. They're going to pay it on electronics. They're going to pay it across the board. And that's really what you're seeing in terms of self I think right now tech stocks you can name like Apple essentially baking in numbers cuts 1,215%. And you. And margin erosion that could be more. So our view in terms of how we're navigating this very similar financial crisis is COVID 2020 is that you have to look on the other side, assuming some sort of normalized earnings into 25 and even 2026. And those are the names, whether it's Microsoft, Apple and some others, that's how you navigate some, you know, looking at the scenarios in terms of how these play out. >> That's interesting because we did get exemptions on semiconductors in the midst of these tariff announcements. But the other area, another area of the market that was very defensive today and held up relatively well were defense contractors themselves. Now, I realize, not necessarily the case for the palantir of the world, but in general, when you're talking about some of these types of companies that are exposed to government revenues that maybe are a little more domestically focused in terms of the stocks they've built out, is that a place to be investing right now? >> Yeah, I mean, I think Palantir and others. But if you look at Lockheed and some of the primary. Yeah, no doubt those are the ones that held up. I think a lot better in terms of defensive. But I think devil's in the details because the reality is when you look at the implementations, you look what comes from foreign perspective. You're talking 40, 50%. A lot of these imitations from a hardware perspective and others. So that's why our view is like what? And to your point, John, is like what are the second third derivatives? What's the ripple effect. What the demand destruction is. I think investors if you look here, these stocks are baking in recession into these stocks. If you think it's anything better and you're basically saying some sort of game of high stakes poker and there will be negotiation, then, you know, these are the names that you ultimately buy", "duration(in seconds)": 289.0, "region": "US"}}

website to look like think about it as like the [Music] MVP hello and welcome back to the channel if you're new here I'm Jen I'm a software engineer based in Seattle Washington and let's try to build my own website this video is kind of inspired by the fact that I really want to start doing my own personal development and coding for fun 5 years in the corporate world I feel like I've never had time to just code for fun or build something that I want to build so starting off the new year I want to start doing that more so I'm going to start building my personal website for some context I'm a back-end software engineer and I literally don't know anything about front end which is kind of embarrassing but yeah I just don't have a lot of experience almost non-existing experience in the front end world so this will be very interesting I was also talking to one of my developer friends and she has also never built her own website before so it's not just me it's a common issue or a common thing among other Engineers specifically those who've only done backend engineering I'm going to sketch out what I want my website to look like it's going to be very simple I don't want anything intricate so far think about it as like the MVP the minimum viable product I literally just want something with my name a few links possibly and a about page about me and that's it and from there I will continue to add on to it and make it better and like make it very fancy possibly add some animation but since I don't even know how to build a website we're just going to keep it very simple for now [Music] [Music] all right so I was asking my other software engineering friend if he's ever built a website and he told me to try GitHub Pages first and then later I could direct my website to a domain registry if I like want to change the host so that's probably what I'll do because I just want something simple for now [Music] w [Music] all right a quick little update it's been like an hour and I probably won't get far into this personal website I'm trying to build right now because there's so many things I'm trying to install on my computer like necessary tools for me to develop easily and it's just taking a long time and I'm get into a lot of like config issues but luckily chat PT is there to just save my day I'm just like inputting all of the errors and using it as like my stack Overflow so that I don't need to like scroll through so many um links by the way I'm not sure if you guys do this but do you guys ever talk to chat GPT it's actually like a really good way to just debug anything or even on your day-to-day you could ask chat GPT literally anything and the response is very latency free it's almost like you're talking to another person I'm just going to give you guys a quick example hey how's it going hey there I'm doing great thanks for asking how about you I'm doing good I'm currently trying to build a website and trying to install all of my tools that I need I'm running into an issue can you help me with that of course I'd love to help what's the issue you're running into I'm going to send you some output errors and based on that can you just give me some Solutions on how to resolve it absolutely just share the errors and I'll help you troubleshoot them it's pretty good all right so I made some progress I was able to use jle as a tool to just see all of the changes in a local server and now I'm just trying to set up my HTML basic file and we'll see about the styling later [Music] [Music] all right so it's the next day and I'm just setting up everything so I could work on my website a little bit more I think today I'm just going to try to wrap up everything and commit all the changes but for now this is what I have so far all right so this is what I have so far it's very simple as you could see I wasn't quite sure what color I wanted to make so I just kept it simple for now today I'm planning on adding some pictures and then having this contact button do something instead of just doing nothing right now and fill up the rest of the pages as for the styling I read online that CSS bootstrap is very simple and beginner friendly so that's what I'm using right now and I'm not going to add any JavaScript I think it's just going to be HTML and CSS and I feel like I just need to keep saying that it's going to be very simple cuz I'm trying to justify to myself that okay it's okay that it's simple for now because I'm used to building like very complex systems and a lot of backend microservices and this just seems like the most simple and dumb down version of anything I could build but it's something I'm doing for the first time so it's okay I'm just trying to convince myself that it's okay [Music] all right so the progress right now is so far really good I'm very content with what I have so far I do want to add like a little section at the bottom that has like the social media icons and when you click it it'll like go to my Instagram page or my Tik Tok page or even my YouTube so I'm going to figure out how to do that and let me tell you guys chat TPT has been so helpful so far I feel like it's just a lot faster to use chat GPT than to like Google things yourself because it'll search the web for you and just like spit out anything you need and I actually use the subscription version so if you guys are interested I would definitely just like try it out because it makes life a lot easier I feel like this is a major thing that's very different at work I usually don't use trypt other than like very simple things cuz a lot of the stuff I'm working on is very internal to Amazon but for like my personal development I'm not afraid to use chat gbt so it's been a very helpful and faster process in my [Music] opinion all right I just finished the initial basic website setup I committed the changes I'll link it down below in my description box if you guys are interested in checking it out let me know if there's any improvements I could make I definitely want to make it more Dynamic but for now it's just a simple website setup and hope you guys enjoyed this I found it really enjoyable just to code for myself and do something for myself in terms of development um I hope to do more of these little side projects and yeah that's pretty much it before I go I also want to add it just felt really weird doing any sort of front-end work because there's so many things I don't understand about how things work but it was very easy to follow because of all of the skills I have built up as a backend engineer so if you're like me and you primarily do backend engineering and you're interested in doing any front end work definitely don't let it scare you because it's a lot more simpler than you think and your skills are transferable so that is it for all I just kind of wanted to add that little snippet and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it let me know Down Below in the comments if you want more of these or any ideas you have for my next little coding project okay really quick I realized towel didn't make an appearance in this video so here you go my little cat service to the world hi how okay I'm sorry all right bye guys", "duration(in seconds)": 583.0, "region": "US"}}

"script": "is coding dead in 2025 [Music] well maybe but not in the way that you think we are not far from a world I think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months where AI is writing 90% of the code and then in 12 months we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code programming is vital but it's just different now so we're going to break up this video into five parts and explain exactly why coding as we know it is dead in 2025 but why programming is not you you you probably recall over the course of the last 10 years 15 years um almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science everybody should learn how to program and in fact it's almost exactly the opposite it is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human everybody in the world is now a programmer a portion of this video has been sponsored by HubSpot okay so let's first take a step back when you first started to code you probably ended up choosing a highle language like Python Java or JavaScript and then maybe even a framework like React or Spring Boot but what you probably never had to do on the job was code in binary or physically work with a bunch of servers and cables in the little room in the back of your office those were the OG software and hardware engineers and kind of like how every generation before says you never had to work as hard as our generation it's somewhat true okay no we didn't have to painfully write things in binary or assembly but we still have to work harder in other ways we now have so much more information at our disposal that technology changes extremely quickly you always have to think on your feet and there's never any job security likewise coding in these highle languages is kind of like the boomers of the past you no longer have to spend hours on Stack Overflow to try to find the answer in fact you shouldn't because the next developer that comes along is just going to default to using Copilot and they'll be a lot faster and a lot more productive than you understanding this first is extremely important in understanding how to get past the death of coding as we know it today we're talking about vibe coding which is from a Andre Karpathy post that went viral recently there's a new kind of coding I call vibe coding where you fully give in to the vibes embrace exponentials and forget that the code even exists so this is a clip from YC's main channel they're talking about the newly coined term vibe coding and I've heard many different terms for this like the AI assisted developer the noode software engineer you name it vibe coding as the video suggests is just coding off of good vibes essentially not really coding but leaning very heavily on AI to code for you but the truth is people always find a way to market software engineering as something easy to do but if it was easy then everyone would be doing it the problem is there are a lot of software engineers but there are not a lot of decent software engineers and the no code approach doesn't mean no coding it just means less thinking about code a lot less for example if I wanted to build out functionality to hit an API that gave me basketball player stats for the past 5 years in the NBA and then use that data to come up with March Madness picks I would probably spend hours trying to build and deploy said API cleaning the data manually adding processing and ranking logic and then displaying the info on the web page but as a Vibe coder defaulting to AI generated code is a lot faster but here's the thing you still need to understand what to do with the code you can't just throw it into the void and hope that it works you still have to understand what code is needed you need tests that have good coverage using optimal data structures and algorithms utilizing solid principles and understanding the dynamics of system design i'm not saying that it hasn't become easier but the skills required are just shifting okay so leading on this whole no code approach I did mention that coding was dead but programming was not and by programming I just mean building off of intricate software systems this can include manually coding things but it doesn't have to i actually had a recent video where I talked about building AI agents without any code at all the cool thing about AI agents are that they're not just LLMs that summarize things for you they actually take action in that video I go through a demo of Operator by OpenAI where it opens up a browser on the cloud browses the web for grocery items to make apple pie and then orders the groceries for me and I set up an AI agent on my own within 5 minutes as well you can actually check that video out here this technologies limit is endless you can use AI agents to automate entire workflows for you without having to do any code this is the future of programming it's evolved into maintaining and designing overarching systems in a clean way this type of programming can get complicated so if you want a free resource to learn more I'd highly recommend checking out HubSpot's free AI agent playbook this playbook goes over a breakdown of things like what AI agents are and how they work how to get started with AI agents and even some common pitfalls to watch out for it also gives you a foundational understanding of the difference between an AI agent and any old AI chatbot for example as shown here AI agents won't just summarize information for you it'll actually do the thing here the guide shows that if you wanted to find your top performing blog posts and draft social media updates for them the AI agent would connect to an analytics API analyze top posts draft social media posts and even schedule the posts for you my favorite section is actually setting up an AI agent yourself as important as the theory is behind it it won't matter if you don't know how to create an AI agent yourself this guide sets up a framework to follow so you can start creating these agents on your own it even goes into detail about low precision versus high precision task frameworks and the common pitfalls that you should definitely avoid at the very end it even reflects on the relationship between AI and humans this 40-page guide is filled with golden nuggets and it's completely free i've linked the HubSpot guide in the description below so you definitely want to check it out okay now back to the video so in the same video clip that I showed you earlier Jensen talked about domain level expertise being on the rise the countries the people that understand how to solve a domain problem in digital biology or in education of young people or in manufacturing or in farming those people who understand domain expertise now can utilize technology that is readily available to you you now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do but what exactly does that mean in the context of software engineering he means having a deep specialized knowledge in a particular field and that's beyond just the technical skills required for coding now it's not just knowing how to code but also understanding context at a high level and knowing how to effectively apply AI within a new domain for example with healthcare this looks like an engineer that understands medical terminology workflows patient privacy laws and how doctors actually make decisions this gives us the ability to focus our problem solving on using the code rather than creating the code in the best possible way of course which by the way still means having an understanding of the code and the theory and how everything works problem solving has always been the foundation for software engineering so this part hasn't actually changed but if you treat it like a technology change then it'll be a lot easier to adapt to this AI revolution then learning new domains won't be hard either in fact it'll feel more creative as you get to explore the AI architecture side of systems and the domain that you're using these systems for do you remember working on a bug or a coding assignment and you just couldn't get one of the tests to run you had to spend hours looking things up on Stack Overflow or Googling random examples that could maybe be applied to your work this was honestly the most frustrating part of the process for me you may know most of the coding fundamentals but there's always something that you don't know and so you end up relying too much on either the gold or the garbage of the internet because let's be honest both exist now I'm not saying that AI can't give you garbage code it definitely can and I've seen it happen a lot but the cool thing is you don't have to put in the effort to manually search for things so even if it gives you gold or garbage you'll have to sift through that but it'll just be a lot faster and if you don't get what you want it'll at least try to modify things or give you a template to jump off of the old way of coding is definitely dead but there is a new way to program the environment around you and it just takes a new type of software engineer to do these things and the sooner you adapt to these changes the easier it'll be to level up your skills it's a marathon at the end of the day so don't get disheartened if you don't understand things or it doesn't come quickly for you just keep trying and pushing along and you'll eventually get", "duration(in seconds)": 527.0, "region":

recent years the United States has been actively developing and testing new supersonic passenger aircraft aiming to set new standards for Speed and efficiency in aviation for instance the startup hermus which was founded by former employees of SpaceX blue origin and generation orbit is developing a supersonic aircraft called quarter horse this aircraft is designed to reach speeds of up to 6,125 kmph five times the speed of sound in 2021 the United States Air Force allocated $60 million for flight testing of this reusable aircraft which could become the fastest in history additionally NASA in collaboration with Lockheed Martin has unveiled the experimental quiet supersonic aircraft x59 qu SST this plane is designed to fly at speeds 1.4 times the speed of sound approximately 1,480 kmph the main goal of the project is to develop technology that significantly reduces the sonic boom when breaking the sound barrier potentially Paving the way for the resumption of commercial supersonic flights over land these projects underscore the United States ambition to reclaim leadership in the field of SuperSonic passenger Transportation combining high speeds with Innovative Technologies to enhance flight comfort and safety in January of 2024 the United States Air Force completed a 3-month testing cycle of the fully electric aircraft Aaliyah developed by Beta Technologies

headed over the next 10 to 15 years stagnation i think stagnation is upon us and I think that the the possibility of econ I've been less worried about inflation in the long term than stagnation uh we we're spending too much money we are overregulated uh the the sort of innovative capacity I know there are a lot of people putting a lot of hopes in AI um and um and maybe that hope is justified in terms of in radical increases in in productivity although they haven't really been able to make the connection between AI and kind of general use productivity yet it's very early so we'll see how that applies to the vast majority of industries um you know hopefully it'll lead to a real productivity increase um but absent you know that sort of worldchanging technology it seems to me that we have not geared our economy for success that we've we've overregulated it that we we've provided enormous amounts of of benefits to people that I think are disincentives to to innovate and and we're still the best bet on the block but I think the entire global economy is in for a world of hurt we've taken out way too much debt all of us what about housing affordability i mean housing affordability could be solved simply by removing so many of the building regulations it's very very difficult to build in a lot of places they're they're huge to to to get a new house built in California is really really difficult like it not as difficult it is in some other countries but it's it's very it's very rough uh if you if you have a create major barriers to entry for creating more housing stock it's going to be very difficult to bring down the price the the other thing is that you know one of the things that that really hasn't happened yet but I think it's it's going to uh is the move away from cities i know there's a lot of talk about this during co I think that if you want a cheaper house you're going to like people want a cheaper house where they currently live and that's not how the market works like the price of your house is what the price of your house is cuz you're competing with other people to buy that house if you would like a cheaper house you might have to think about not living where you live and that's a that's a hard thing for people but one of the weirdest things about kind of the the American experiment right now is that if you look at the history of Americans moving for jobs fewer Americans right now are moving for jobs than any time in modern American history which is super weird it's actually way easier to move now than it was when you're you know grandpappy's grandpappy had to get on a covered wagon and cross Native American territory and sit by a river and wait for bad to happen to him like like now if you want to move it actually is quite doable so if you want to move for a job you can i understand why people want to stay put i I mean I understand you got family nearby and all of that sort of stuff i mean these are real considerations but I think that there has set into a lot of the American mind this idea that it's owed to me i get to live where I want and the price is going to be low i get to live where I want and take the job that I want and get the pay that I want it's like you don't get to dictate to the world what the conditions are the conditions are what the conditions are and so if you want to alleviate the the h I mean you had a housing stock problem back in in major cities in the mid- 19th century you know people did they got on wagons they went across a mountain and built like a hut in the middle of nowhere like this is the way typ typically the way that housing stock problems get solved is you go to a place where the housing is cheaper more affordable you can build it yourself that's how it will be solved this time too because it certainly isn't going to get solved by by rent control or by government subsidized housing yeah do you think home ownership is necessary cuz when I look at the price between renting and buying and I've said this a lot recently that renting is substantially cheaper right now so it makes more sense in my opinion to rent over the next 10 years than buy a house and speculate on its value i mean I think it depends where it's all locationally based i think that would I buy in Los Angeles right now no i think the prices there are wildly inflated i think there's also a real weird stickiness to the market right now because of the mortgage rates and because the mortgage rates have been so high that means that there's less housing stock available on the market because nobody wants to sell their house and then get into a mortgage that's twice what they were paying so that that's that's been a real problem um but yeah I mean listen I've always been a a big fan of home ownership we since I got married we've never rented i I always bought um because I just felt like I was flushing my money down the toilet but that's because the math worked if the math doesn't work math doesn't work and so you have to make the best decision i mean if if you'd rather take the money that you're saving on rent and put it in the stock market then go for it that might pencil out for you better you know historically speaking depending on the market it may pencil out better to to buy your house than than to rent your house i also It depends how risk-seeking or risk riskaverse you are right i'm I'm I tend to be relatively riskaverse about my investments and so I like real estate as a riskaverse investment meaning it's never going to be worth zero my house is worth now if I hold on to it for long enough it will be worth more than I'm paying for the house right now uh so you know again that's a pretty riskaverse way of viewing housing um and I think for some people that's that's probably the right way to view it another interesting idea that I wasn't exposed to before like four or five months ago is that the average square footage of new developments has just been steadily increasing over the past like 40 or so years and people are getting in places that are like 23 26 2,700 ft which is a very large home whereas back in the day people were more used to like the 1,200 square feet to the 1500 i mean you said you grew up in 1100 and obviously it wasn't super comfortable but it still worked and it was conducive to you i remember so my parents when I was 11 moved into like a 2,400 foot house and I was like \"This place is a palace this place is enormous.\" Yeah and now we live in a place that's like three times that size a lot of developments are like 3,000 ft and stuff like that well yeah i mean because if if you're because again upward mobility means that people want nicer stuff all the time and they want more space and they want higher ceilings for example and if you walk into a house that's built in the '50s now most people you walk into a house that's built in like this place is cramped what were people 3 ft tall like what's the deal and you know that's cuz the market tends to push the limits of of what's available and what's possible i think it'd be interesting if there were more tax incentives for developers to create smaller square footage uh houses because it's more profitable right now for them to make the bigger houses like the land prices are so expensive that they have to build bigger to get that ROI on square footage and then if they get incentives it's the taxpayer that's then still paying for it the money's got to come from somewhere yeah so either way the money's got to I mean there's there's a very good free market reason why they're building bigger houses and if somebody wants to try and make a bundle off of making small single family homes again I think part of the problem is that the places where people want small single family homes are likely to be in major cities where those are way more expensive and and if you take that same price and then you apply it to like rural Texas you can have yourself a giant ranch so", "duration(in seconds)": 378.0, "region": "US"}}

is with us here in the studio binners thanks for being with us and the brilliant Tessa Dunlop historian author and broadcaster also with us uh Tessa thank you um should talk about Donald Trump and his first full day in office today gosh she's man on a mission very busy been very very busy signing executive orders soaking up the love uh doing his very best in uh performance politics but look it's working uh he's wasted no time setting out his plans uh so far he's declared an emergency at the southern US border along with dozens of other executive orders on climate change and immigration first Donald Trump there what we know that he's done in the last few moments has reinstated the remain in Mexico program um that forces Asylum Seekers to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their American cases it was uh halted by Joe Biden soon after he took over at the White House but the Department of Homeland Security reinstated it with immediate effect and he's also given permission he's also given permission for Border officials to raid schools this gives you something of the temperature of this and the the extent I suppose which Donald Trump Trump's prepared to go for in Immigration which there's no doubt about it Michael one of the big pegs for Donald Trump it was the economy and immigration which got him over the line and into the wre housee absolutely yes I mean the Americans have been worried about illegal immigration for some time but the scale is completely off of anybody's imagination I mean it's enormous and it's not just Mexicans fleeing you know violent and poverty and whatever in their country it's much of Latin America tramping through Mexico Central America tramping through Mexico to the US border waiting for a chance to get across any way they can and sometimes assisted by gangs and particular um kind of cers who who sort of help them guide them to the right place to cross and it just infuriates Americans I can see why I mean one doesn't have to be racist about it and I do think you've got to try to deal with this in a humane way the immigration is infuriates Americans than Donald Trump actions yeah okay that's what infuriates people because they say you know when these guys get here now the difficulty is that American industry is totally dependent and agriculture on this cheap and sometimes illegal Labor uh and if he tries deporting two or three million people a lot of American Business would simply collapse I mean people say oh we don't like them we don't like them but actually they're quietly hiring them to do jobs they don't want to do or where they can't find anyone to fill the slot uh and so uh in the Heartland of America these illegal immigrants are very very important there have been amnesties every so often to try to start again from scratch and a lot of people have got citizenship it never really works it doesn't reduce the demand people still come and why not because you can see a very booming and prosperous country just across the border compared to your own poverty and misery where you are Tessa of late I've had to revert the enlightenment philosophers just to stay sane and um I've rediscovered Jean jaac Russo who talked about the will of the people and then he caveated the idea of the will of the people reminding us that actually very quickly the will of the people can become the tyranny of the people unless there are checks and balances we know what happened there was French Terror meanwhile America of course established a much more constitutional uh Republic with lots of checks and balances and by goodness they're going to be tested but one of the things that Russo was so worried about of course is that while you know a more absolutist form of government can make trains run on time although I'm not sure there were trains in his day but it's not so good at perhaps looking after the vulnerable and deciding who should or shouldn't belong to a nation what concerns me most is that Trump you know appealing to the will of the the braing mob it's it's it's the language he uses the performative flourishes we saw them from Elon Musk the sort of the direct provocations yes you'll have peace in Gaza but let's just trigger it over there in the West Bank you know actually just the language he's using about way in which he's going to term illegal migration so that if it gets the sort of terrorist status that could arguably I notic certainly in in the times they're discussing this Times newspaper they're discussing this lead to potential military incursions into Mexico those raids and schools is this really necessary this is red meat to the braing Mob so let's just pray for those American checks and balances but also a lot of it is hot air this is a man who says he's going to make America great again it's also a man who had four years with his hand on the tiller and more factories closed under the last Trump Administration than opened okay and what really matters in America the economy stupid there was one market moving announcement after another as Donald Trump started his new term as US president from vowing to unleash fossil fuels to ending supports for EVS and hitting pors on a promise of sweeping tariffs the pledges kept coming America will be a manufacturing Nation once again and we have something that no other manufacturing Nation will ever have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it with us Equity markets shut for a public holiday Monday it fell to Asian and European investors to give the First Response the moves proved surprisingly muted Japan's Nik index ended the day modestly higher while South Korea's Cosby and China's Shanghai composite indexes ended broadly flat shares in some big exporters weighed after Trump indicated tariffs could still be coming if not on day one Hyundai Motor which has a plant in Mexico was among the fallers losing about 1% European shares then opened flat Rising Healthcare and financial shares offsets broader losses coming from uncertainty over Trump's proposed tariffs European major automakers felt pressure though stellantis was down around 2% while Volkswagen BMW and Mercedes all fell too oil traded gently lower amid conflicting signals Trump's promise to drill baby drill suggested higher Supply ahead but he also cut incentives for EVS and promised to refill us oil reserves potentially boosting demand the reaction on currency markets was more marked after a dip following the lack of action on trade the dollar then recovered some ground following Trump's signal that tariffs were probably still we're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada because they're allowing uh vast numbers of people Canada is very bad abuser also vast numbers of people to come in and fentol to come in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both fell versus the green back in response", "duration(in seconds)": 440.0, "region": "US"}}

instances Russian units have been forced to retreat after failed offensives leaving behind significant amounts of equipment the losses are compounded by a lack of proper reinforcements and coordination between different branches of the Russian military Ukrainian intelligence and reconnaissance have also played a key role in identifying and targeting vulnerable Russian positions leading to a number of successful ambushes as a result Russian forces have been unable to achieve their objectives in luhansk despite months of trying to capture the region the failure to breach Ukrainian

become a smarter investor then smash the like button and let's get started for more videos on investing or personal finance or even paying for college please subscribe to the channel so let's start at the beginning with what even the stock market is it's basically just a marketplace where you can buy individual small portions of companies that exist in the real world you're not just buying pieces of paper or electronic data that doesn't mean anything you're actually purchasing a partial ownership of a company that is existing in the real world doing business every day the people that run these companies have decided to split the company up into these tiny slivers of stock called shares when you go and buy a share you are purchasing one of these tiny slivers of ownership of the company which makes you part owner owner of a company that's pretty cool right but if you're going to be part owner of a company then you probably want to know a little bit about the companies right you want to make sure that it's worth you owning part of that company you want to make sure that they're going to do well that they're going to be successful there's a lot of data that goes into determining that which one should you dive in on and which one should you stay away from that could ultimately fail this is where individual stocks come in you can buy just one stock of one company and avoid every other company because you really believe in this one company however the danger of buying just one company stock is that if that company has a downturn or doesn't do well or ultimately fails and goes bankrupt then you've just lost all of your investments in one foul swoop has anybody heard of Enron so while there is potential to see very large gains if your one company does well there's also the possibility that you could lose it all so it's a highrisk potentially High reward opportunity but there are ways to invest in the stock market that minimize that risk dramatically now I'm not a financial adviser I just have throw that out there in the disclaimer here but for your typical beginner in investing in stocks I do not recommend going with individual stocks I recommend going with funds specifically index funds but we'll get there so you definitely want to stay watching till the end so breaking down what a fund is in terms of a mutual fund think about it like buying flowers if you buy one flower you've bought one stock but if that one flow dies you have nothing however if you buy a whole bouquet of flowers you not only have one stock you have a whole bunch of stocks that are all part of the bouquet when you're buying into a mutual fund you're usually buying into a whole collection of stocks that have been bundled into one price and you pay $10 for the whole bundle instead of you know $2 for that flower $7 for this flower 20 bucks for this flower $2 for that flow it's just one price and it gets you all the flowers another way I've heard it described is like honeybees again if you buy one b and that b dies well then you put all this money towards your 1B but now he's dead you've lost it all but if you buy a whole Colony a whole beeh hiive now if any one you know one two three a whole bunch of the bees don't do well they've got all these other bees making up for it so you're still getting your honey even though some of those bees haven't made it but if you only bought one it's a lot riskier if that one bee does really well hey cool but if that bee dies you're in trouble so I would say instead of buying individual flowers and bees buy the bouquet buy The Beehive buy the mutual fund but there's a specific type of mutual fund that I recom recommend coming up the time that I don't recommend now they're not all bad some of them are good but personally for beginners getting started I would stay away from actively managed funds the reason is because they have higher fees usually around 1% now a 1% fee doesn't sound like a lot but if you look at it over the course of long-term investment strategy it can be a huge difference if you were to invest $100 over the course of 35 years $100 a month for 35 years you would end up at an 8% % rate of return around $26,000 a little bit more than that if that rate was consistent over that full time if you had to pay a mutual fund manager 1% of that then your returns actually are more like 7% instead of 8% because that extra percent is actually being paid out each year to the fund manager so now after those same 35 years have elapsed instead of having $26,000 in your account you only have about $165,000 in your account that 1% annual fee cost you almost $40,000 and $40,000 compared to the potential 206,000 that's almost 20% lost so while you're looking at 1% thinking that's not very much but over the course of 35 years that turned into over 20% loss that you're paying somebody else to manage your money for you so over the long haul it can really kill your growth potential which brings us to index funds and why I think they're a good way to go for beginners an index fund can do the same thing as an actively man managed fund except it simply mirrors a portion of the market or in the case that I recommend the entire market and then you can benefit from that same fund analogy where if some companies do poorly but others do well you're still going to grow over time but their fees are exponentially lower in fact if you look at VT Sachs which is vanguard's total market index fund their fee is 0.04% so instead of 1% or more to an actively managed fund manager you're paying 0.0 4% so if we use our previous example if you taking $100 a month for 35 years and that ends up going at an 8% interest rate or growth rate you end up with about $26,000 at the end of that well if you're removing 0.04% as a fee that you pay annually then your returns over those same 35 years is actually about $25,000 so instead of losing 40 Grand to a mutual fund manager you've lost one maybe $2,000 over that same period of time to pay for an index fund so so your growth potential is about the same as far as your total return but the amount you lose in fees to an index fund is way less way less I would always do it this way so for me that's the huge selling point of index funds over mutual funds that are actively managed now there are different kinds of index funds as well you can have index funds that are just indexed towards a specific industry so I again recommend something like an index that follows the S&P 500 or even broader than that like a VT sack VT sax vtsax is just the ticker symbol for this mutual fund that Vanguard offers that mirrors the total market and another reason to go with index funds is because Warren Buffett bet hedge fund managers that the S&P 500 would actually outperform their Investments over 10 years and he got people to accept his bet of a million dollars to try to beat the market and over 10 years the S&P 500 Index outperformed the hedge fund managers now there were years where the hedge fund managers did better but over the course of the Long Haul the full 10 years they couldn't beat the market consistently over time that's what managers try to say they say we'll pick things that are going to beat the market hey any given day month or year they might and that's what they're going to point to to say well this is how we've done it for this year and that year and and so we're super successful but over the course of your retirement like preparing for 10 20 30 years no fund manager is going to consistently beat the market over a 30-year period period at least a very very small portion of them will and the odds that you've picked the one that will are very low so it's better to just stick with Index Fund investing for the long term and that's a more secure way to guarantee growth over the long-term Investments and who am I to argue with Warren Buffett right and then there are ETFs these are called exchang traded funds ETFs are like index funds with a few key differences ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the day so as you have probably Seen On TV throughout the day a stock market price can go up or down so with an ETF you can buy the price at this second you can look online at a on a broker which offers ETFs and you can say I want the pricee now and then you buy it at that price an index fund is bought and sold at the price that is set at the end of the trading day so you can't buy in the middle of the day at a specific price point that you want right this second it doesn't work like that but for long-term investors thinking 20 or 30 years the specific and minimal differences between being able to pick the price uh at you know 2 in the afternoon as opposed to the end of the day it's going to have a minimal effect over the course of your Investments so it's it's kind of just a preference thing and the other key difference is the minimum investment required to get started so with an index fund remember we talked about VT saxs the minimum requirement to invest in VT saxs is $3,000 however the ETF version of VT saxs you can invest for the price of a single share and there are also Brokers like Robin Hood that allow you to purchase fraction shares so if a if a single stock share was $100 but you didn't have $100 you only had $20 then with Robin Hood you could invest just $20 and buy one fifth of one share and so you can buy fractional shares so you don't even have to have the price of a full share and you definitely don't have to have the $3,000 minimum investment to invest straight into an index fund like BT saxs so either way index funds and ETFs are a great way for beginners to get started in the market with an investment that is already Diversified and are already has low fees so if you have any further questions about stocks mutual funds index funds or ETFs go ahead and throw that in the comments and smash that like buttton", "duration(in seconds)": 577.0, "region":

"script": "I have spent the last decade of my life immersing \nmyself in the field of finance and money through a   degree in finance a qualification in accounting \nand then a career in Investment Banking and one   of the most life-changing skills I have learned \nthrough it all is how to handle my own finances   recognize my bad money habits and break free from \nthem so in this video I'm going to share with you   nine of the most common bad money habits that \nhold people back and tips on how to break out   of them number one paying yourself last I first \nheard of this in the book Rich Dad Poor Dad by   Robert Kiyosaki and it's one of the blueprints in \nachieving Financial Freedom Robert explains that   the way people pay their bills can be broken down \ninto two types the first way is the Poor People's   habit and that is through paying yourself last \nso as soon as your paycheck comes in you then   pay your rent your phone bill your subscriptions \nyou find your social plans and then you'll save   whatever's left over if there is even any money \nleft to save the second method he talks about is   the rich people's habit and they do the complete \nopposite they pay themselves first and that is   what you want to do take 10 minimum and put that \ninto your savings account the minute you get paid   treat it like paying a bill this is so important \nand by doing this you're guaranteeing that that   buying their things before you pay yourself the \nsecond bad money habit is getting comfortable   with bad debt it seems that debt these days is \nactually the norm people are using debt to by   the smallest of things to buy presents to buy \nclothes I have a straight wall that is unless   I can afford to pay for that thing outright and \ncash I shouldn't be buying it with any form of   debt remember credit card companies want you to \nbe bad with your finances because that's how they   make money from this the average credit card \ninterest rate is 22 which cancels all kind of   benefits and rewards these credit card companies \nare providing if you're not able to pay them off   number one which is about paying yourself first \nand essentially it's saving enough so that you   this six months of buffer it's through that paying \nyourself first start putting that 10 away and once   you have your stockpile then you can start using \nthe additional money you save to building into   your investment fund and looking at Investments \nnumber four is not knowing your income or expenses   properly until you know what your starting point \nis how do you know where you want to be there's   something called lifestyle inflation and that is \nyour spending will rise as your income Rises the   more money you make the more you spend and it's \na cycle make more money buy a bigger house buy a   financially they know their assets they know their \nliabilities they have a clear goal on where they   want to go financially and all this all the steps \nthey need to take to get there are more likely to   get a lot of money and build wealth compared \nto people who just fantasize about money but   have no idea how to go about it how they plan to \nacquire it or how to manage it just being mindful   of their stuff and seeing those numbers in black \nand white will trigger you into action fifth bad   money habit is having expensive Hobbies a lot of \npeople like to shop and I guess yeah part of this   if you want to improve your financial position you \ncan firstly save more of your existing income or   you can make more money and create more income \nstreams and the ideal combination is a mixture   of both you can't build wealth if you're making \nmore money and spending all but you also can't if   you're just focusing on the saving side because \nthere is a cap to how much you can save using   those cashback sites will only get you so far so \nto truly build wealth you have to think of both   sides of the equation both how you will save a \nlarger percentage of your income but also how   you will make more money saving moneyside has a \ncap the making money side does not it's infinite   there is unlimited potential upside whether it's \ninvesting in the stock market asking for a pay   rise starting a side hustle you want to break the \nbad money habit of thinking about saving money   is going to massively increase your wealth number \nseven paying too much in taxes taxes are going to   be the single biggest expense in your life whilst \neveryone has to pay tax a lot of people just   wealthy they have knowledge of illegal corporate \nstructures that come with tax advantages they hire   tax advisors that help them minimize their tax \nbills so if you want to get one step ahead one of   the best ways to increase your wealth is through \nunderstanding tax rules in a way that's stack up   in your favor for example investing through \nan Isa or a Roth IRA which is an investment   account that shelters your dividend and profit \nfrom taxes or operating under a business instead   if you are someone who disagrees with this and \nprefers to pay more taxes regardless of whether   or not you can reduce it legally then it doesn't \nhurt to understand the tax rules and reduce that   tax bill so that you can instead use the money \nto give back to things that directly align with   your values instead of letting someone else decide \nwhere that money should be going if you want me to   make a video on tax I was planning to I already \nhave a summary on what I want to include but I   have been a bit skeptical about whether to release \nthis it's a topic that can go either way so let   me know in the comments below if you want to see \nthat number eight waiting too long to invest when   you start having savings you have that stockpile \nthat buffer that we spoke about then you want to   start looking at investing that money so that \nyour money starts working for you and you want   to diversify those Investments so you can weather \ndifferent situations operations that come around   in life but you want to avoid leaving that money \nin a bank account because inflation is a thing   and it means that you're essentially losing money \nevery year so I have a mixture of safe Investments   of riskier Investments that I'm willing to lose \nas well start looking at different investment   strategies once you've saved up enough don't leave \nany additional money more than you need to in a   bank account I have another video and what you \ncan be doing with your money in times like the   current recession and I'll link that here for you \nas well there's always going to be reasons why   you can't invest because you don't have time you \ndon't have enough money you don't know where to   start but the longer you put off investing the \nharder you will have to work to get that same   may also enjoy another one that I've linked here \non Building Wealth

A lot of us go through the world\nthinking that when we turn 65, something magical is going to happen and you get\nto retire. And that's not true because if you don't\nhave any money, you can't stop working when you're 65. And the flip side of\nthat, you don't need to wait until you're 65 either. If you have enough\nmoney, you can retire at 55 or 45 or 36 like I did. And so it's just kind of\nturning this whole idea of traditional retirement age on its head. My name is Jeremy Schneider. I'm 41 years old. I live in San Diego\nand I reached financial independence at 36. I grew up in southeast Michigan, outside\nof Detroit. My parents were kind of middle class. I went to college at the University of\nMichigan. I studied computer science. I was in college from 1998 to 2002 when\nthe dotcom boom was happening, and I would see these young people just\na few years older than me who were making millions with tech startups. And it inspired me to start young. And then as I was graduating from\nMichigan, I turned down a job offer from Microsoft to start my own Internet\ncompany. But I recorded my bank account the\nmoment the wire came through. I clicked\nrefresh and it jumped from $100,000 or so to over $2 million, which was pretty\nsurreal. And it was very abstract. I don't really know how much money that\nwas. The day after the company sold, I was\nsuddenly in integration mode with this very nice company that just gave me\nmillions of dollars. It was an especially busy time and so I\ncouldn't just like ditch and head to Fiji. I just saw that as like a finish\nline that when I sold the company and made millions, I would just like be on\nthis beach. I was talking to the CEO of the company\nthat bought our company and I told him that vision. I was like, \"All right,\nI'm going to be on the beach.\" And he asked me, \"What are you going to\ndo when you get back?\" And what he meant was, you can't spend\nyour life on a beach, you know? I mean, you could, but that's kind of a\ncrappy life. So I guess it dawned on me that I\ncouldn't just, like, spend the rest of my days sipping Mai Tais on the beach\nbecause that would be really boring. I worked for the company that bought us\nfor two years, and then in April of 2017, I quit my job and officially was\nretired or financially independent at the age of 36. And that was the year when I played\nvideo games and traveled for a year. That first year of being unemployed or\nretired or whatever you want to call it. It was just kind of like every day was\nthe weekend. I would always get asked like, \"What do\nyou do all day if you're not at work?\" And my answer would be like, \"What do\nyou do on Saturdays?\" It's amazing how quickly your time fills\nup with meeting with friends or working out or working on projects or playing\ngames or traveling. And so I kept really busy and it was\nreally fun at first. But as the year dragged on, I found that\nthere's something missing in my life. There actually was a moment where I had\nan epiphany where a year after I retired and played video games for a year, I\nwas on a vacation in Mexico and for a week I wasn't playing this game\nStarcraft II, which I had become very addicted to. And I realized what a\nmassive waste of time that was and how I basically just gave away a year of my\nlife to play this game. And so I decided that I didn't want to\ndo that anymore. And so I came back and before I played\nanother game, I uninstalled it cold turkey from my computer and haven't\nplayed it ever since. Get it out of there. At the time, it\nwasn't very calculated that I needed exactly $3 million. It was more of just a sense of over the\ncourse of two years, the growth of my investments were outpacing my actual\nW-2 income. Now, with the benefit of knowing about\nthe FIRE movement much more in depth, I know about the 4% rule, which says you\ncan live on about 4% of your investment portfolio. 4% of $3 million is\n$120,000, which was like twice as much as I'd ever spent in a year. And so I think that I was easily FIRE at\n$3 million. My net worth is about $4.4 million. $1.1 million is the value of my home you\nsee behind me. I was a lifelong renter until I was 38\nyears old. I was actually living in my friend's\ngarage, which was converted to an apartment. I have a traditional IRA\nwith about $50,000 and a new 401(k) with my new company that's got about\n$15,000. The other $3 million or so is all in a\ntaxable account just because it didn't fit in the tax advantaged accounts. I think my biggest expense is probably travel right now. I'm just going on vacation. Restaurants, I think I spend about $800\na month. I don't have a mortgage. My home that\nyou see behind me is 100% paid for. I actually applied for a mortgage and\nwas denied because I didn't have a job. And so I just wrote a check and paid\ncash. I don't buy things if I don't think I\nneed them. So, for example, if I look over to my\nleft, I see the keyboard on my computer, which I use every single day, which is\nfrom college. And so people walk into my house and\nthey see this like 1998 era keyboard and think it's ridiculous, but it's a great\nkeyboard and it works fine. And so why would I spend more money if I\ndon't need to? I live alone, don't have any roommates\nor a wife just yet. Welcome to my home. I live here in sunny San Diego in this\ntwo-bedroom condo. Come on, I'll show you around. This is my living room where I watch\nCNBC Make It. This is my office. I sit here. I make Instagram posts,\nTikTok reels. The kitchens over here. When I bought this house for $712,000,\neverything was different. There was a gigantic wall that came\nright down here. I knocked down the wall, remodeled the\nkitchen from this big built-in table. It was about $100,000 in total for the\nremodel. Guest bathroom. I actually did the tile work in that\nbathroom myself. One of the few parts of the remodel. This is the master bedroom that includes\nthe peak view of Mission Bay in sunny San Diego way over there in the corner. Over here is the master bathroom. When I bought the place, this was all\npink with a tub. And I put in a total new shower. Tile. One of these fancy lighted mirrors so I\ncan look at myself every morning. Do my daily affirmations. And that is the house tour. I'm going to bed. I started an Instagram account where my\nplan was to share daily personal finance and money tips. Every single day I would get the exact\nsame question, which is like, \"How do I get started investing? What's a Roth IRA? What's an index fund? What investment do I buy?\" And then after a year and a half, it was\nmid 2020 and I was kind of bored during the pandemic. And I essentially started\na company by mistake by launching a paid product. I wanted to create just a\nvideo course that walked through it that kind of was like a brain dump from my\nbrain to everyone who was asking these questions. So I decided to sell the\nvideo course for $79. And the first week of launching this\ncourse, we made like $110,000. And so I was like, \"Oh, it took me four\nyears on my first company to make $110,000. So this might actually be a real\nbusiness.\" I do a 25% profit share. So 25% of our profit is split among the\nemployees based on seniority. I have a friend, and about 10 years ago\nwe started a website called What's That\nCharge? Which helps you identify mysterious\ncharges on your credit card statement. My buddy and I own it 50/50. And so it's been live for 10 years. I think we're going to make like $7,000\nthis month. I think that I've found peace with where\nI'm at in life financially. I don't feel like I need more to be\nhappy. And so I'm not really chasing any big\nfinancial goals. I'm still not totally immune to ideas of\nlike a bigger place or a vacation home or something like that. So that might\nbe nice if the company does well or my investments continue to grow. If I didn't have income from my current\njob, I can live forever on my investments. I'm living way below the\nsafe withdrawal rate from my portfolio short of some sort of economic\napocalypse in the future, which no one can predict. But I can live forever on\nmy investments.", "duration(in seconds)": 546.0, "region": "US"}}

"[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video so OpenAI has launched their GPT40 image generation and it's probably the most worthwhile product that OpenAI has shared in a while i mean I'm not dumb enough to only generate Gibli images with it and I have actually been using it a lot for application designs believe it or not it's one of the best image generators that can generate some really cool designs that I have seen as of now the designs are probably better than what I make and it can also make transparent images which is what I really liked about it which means that we can even use it to make assets backgrounds and much more i mean people are making YouTube thumbnails with it and whatnot anyway I wanted to show you guys how I have been using OpenAI's new image generation to generate designs and then make it work accordingly so let me show you how it works how I have been using it and everything like that but before we do that let me tell you about Ninja Chat ninja Chat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month you get access to top AI models like GPT40 Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash all in one place i've been using Gemini for quick research but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side by side their mind map generator is a gamecher for organizing complex ideas as well the basic plan gives you 1,000 messages 30 images and five videos monthly with higher tiers available if you need more use my code king 25 for 25% off any plan or king 40 yearly for 40% off annual subscriptions check the link in description to try it yourself now back to the video now their new GPT40 image generation is free with some limits on chat GPT and it is currently under heavy usage and sometimes it may show you a waiting period after which you can generate the image anyway so if we talk about what we can make it do then there are majorly two things that it can do it can generate images from scratch or you can also give it an image for it to edit similar to how Gemini's native image editing works as well although this is comparatively better one of the major things that I use it for is actually web design as it can render text extremely well and is great at generating reference designs so one thing that I did is that I gave it a mockup of a design this is a design of an LLM testing application that is basically a much more intuitive interface for the LLM testings that I do so here I just gave it this image which is a very basic mockup of how I want things to look and then I asked it to take this image and make it better looking in a minimal style with a bit of shininess then we get the stuff made here one thing that I have seen and this happens almost every time is that it zooms in on the text and makes things a lot more zoomed in for some reason even if you don't ask it to do it it still does that so I don't know why it does that anyway still it is great as it does give you an outline of how it should look it looks really good considering what I had prompted it to do and this looks great it's great for brainstorming design ideas and everything like that so now we can take this image to something like Windsurf or Klein and ask it to work on this but since we are here I also want to show some other use cases for what you can do with it you can edit any image easily but one of the other things is that if you make games then you can have it make assets for you like sprite sheets logos or whatever you might want it to do and it's actually quite good at that as well you can use this as well accordingly for those but now let me show you how I generally convert the designs into proper web pages that we can then extend further so just open up the coder of your choice i'll be using Klein for now because that's what I like to use generally i'll be using Gemini 2.5 Pro for now as I generally like to use that for most of the tasks these days now just upload the image that you have just generated and you can also upload the original wireframe one because the layout is a bit messed up in the generation so we can just ask it to take the style from the generation and the layout from the original one and now just ask it to replicate it although make sure that you have a basic nextjs app setup or you can just ask it to set that up as well i already have a basic nextjs app setup here now once we send the prompt you'll see that it starts working on it gemini has always been great at replicating image designs and this Gemini 2.5 Pro is also really great at it anyway you can see that it's now done and it has generated the code and applied it and everything like that we can now go ahead and run it and boom you can see that this looks kind of great for a oneshot generation it's really awesome for sure we can now obviously go ahead and make some changes to it as well let's ask it to make some changes to it as well and let me try to make it a bit better okay it's now doing that and if we wait a bit then it's now done and it did this pretty well if we run it then this looks kind of great as well we can obviously keep going to make it even better but this video is about how you can use GPT40's image generation capability with it to generate some cool stuff currently its image capability is not available as a proper API which is a little bad and I hope that it becomes available soon because that will allow us to integrate it into Klein and then use it without the need to navigate to things like chat GPT currently you will face a bit of an issue with chat GPT as everyone is busy generating Gibli but still it is a really great one for designs making assets and much more stuff like that you can also generate transparent assets with it which means that you can like ask it to generate a whole design first then ask it for transparent assets that you can then merge together and use it accordingly that's majorly how I use it i really like how this workflow works because it can create some great designs as well it is also great at a bunch of other stuff but it is still bad at some stuff like sometimes the design is a lot misaligned and goes out of the way and does something finicky or sometimes the text glitches out so make sure that you use it accordingly for that gemini 2.5 Pro is really good at vision tasks and it also replicates the stuff pretty well and it also works with multiple images which allows you to give it the first wireframe and then give it the mockup and ask it to merge the style and layout accordingly which is kind of cool overall it's pretty cool anyway share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel you can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks i'll see you in the next video bye [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 511.0, "region": "US"}}

you know if I were to start over again and have to relearn all the stuff that I know what would I do today to learn about the lowest level for those of you that don't know my name is l level learning my day job I'm a security researcher but on the internet I teach people how to code in languages like C and teach them how computers work through languages like assembly and others if you're new here welcome to the channel hit that sub button and let's learn how to be lowl together so how would I get from zero to lowlevel as fast as possible thought this question really hard and I came up with the following three answers three things that I would do today to get good at the low level starting with number one code in a lowlevel language this probably goes without saying but if you know how to code right now maybe you know how to code in python or Ruby or God forbid JavaScript I would say take that knowledge of programming and go and learn a language that gives you raw unfettered access to the memory of your process space and the language I recommend for that is the c programming language I know there's a lot of talk and I talk about this a lot on my YouTube channel if C is the appropriate language for the future when it comes to systems programming I think that rust eventually will take over for C we're not talking about that today in this video I want to talk about why C is the best language to learn with also we're not going to get into the holy war of whether or not C is a high or low-level language for the purposes of this video C is a low-level language discussed in the comments learning to code effectively in C forces you to learn effective memory management it forces you to learn how to write code that is bulletproof because if you don't the code will just inherently be unsafe there are lots of things you have to do in C to not leak memory to not give your code access to hackers and to not have the crash the code just crash whenever it runs the number one project I tell people to write when they're trying to learn to code maybe they know the language but don't have a project to go after is to write an HTTP server and I know that sounds fairly Advanced for somebody who may be new to a language but it will teach you not only the ins and outs of the HTTP RFC but a lot of really important things about programming for example when you're writing the HTTP parser you have to not only write the code that adheres to the RFC but then you also have to think of your code defensively you're going to be inprocessing and reading code from literally anybody on the internet you have to treat your code as if it's being attacked you have to code defensively writing an HTTP server will allow you to get really familiar with how to read the documentation of a language you're not just going to know the networking stack off the top of your head you have to learn how to read Man pages read documentation and read how return values work in the language of your choosing I think learning C teaches you how computers work at a fairly high level so go and take your programming knowledge and learn a language like C as step one step two go learn an assembly variant I'm not saying you have to be some wizard who can just look at an assembly blob and tell you exactly what's going on as fast as possible I am saying that knowing an assembly variant and knowing how the CPU works at the instruction level gives you a really really good understanding of how your code is going to behave and also if you can look at a blob of c and figure out basically how it's going to happen under the hood in the CPU architecture it gives you a superpower in choosing what code you make and deciding how to design your code so that it performs better the best way you can learn assembly right now is by taking this snippet of C code and I'll put it in the description below and go and compile that in if you can object dump this piece of code go to the main function in reverse engineer how it works you will learn the basic 101 of that CPU architecture and that will give you a significant advantage on how things work and number three once you've learned how to code in a low-l language once you've begin to understand when you write that low-l code what architecture code gets spit out by the compiler and generally how the architecture works I recommend learning the basics of reverse engineering now this pays off in a number of ways one maybe your job is just a malware reverse engineer maybe you're a Bug Hunter looking for bugs and taking binaries apart or maybe you're just somebody who is looking at code and you can't figure out why it doesn't work learning the basics of reverse engineering will teach you fundamentally not only how things work but how things are engineered and what the final output of the compiler will be also when you do reverse engineering challenges typically they're all based around a specific thing that you should know or like a specific fact like maybe it has to do with the Trap flag in the Intel CPU or maybe it has to do with the global offset table all of these challenges teach you a little thing that you can kind of put into your toolbox of knowledge that over time you'll just begin to H have a holistic picture of how binaries are how binaries are constructed in the Linux operating system for example and I highly recommend going to crack. one this is not sponsored this is not an ad it's just a website that I like where there are people who write reverse engineering challenges and you can download them run them on your computer run them in a VM because you have no idea if the code is malicious or not um but I think these challenges are really cool and an easy and fast way to learn the skills of reverse engineering and ultimately one of the lowest level techniques and then finally actually number four secret bonus um I think that another way to get really good at low level stuff is to pick up a board to learn to write C on that board so this for example is an stm32 it's an arm-based board this is the stm32 F7 nucleo if you can learn C if you then learn an assembly architecture if you can then get that code to run on a specific architecture of microcontroller so again be it like an STM maybe an Arduino or risk v-b Bo an esp32 something like that it will give you the ability to read a data sheet to understand how to interpret that data sheet and how to crossport your code to a board that can run somewhere else as Computing gets more advanced as computers get older and older and they get more technologically Superior as time goes on I feel like we lose touch with how CPUs work at a basic level I can literally take out my iPhone and access any information that I need to in the world and the whole Magic of what's going on we literally tricked rocks into thinking I think it's kind of lost on us so part of what I made this YouTube channel to do is to teach people and remind people that you know computers work and to make sure that we have a cohort of people moving on into the future that once the gray beards of the world lest tals of the world that built these systems move on and possibly pass away you know we have the second generation of low-l Architects that that know how CPUs work so if you think that's cool or you enjoyed this video or you want to be a part of that cohort hit that sub button really appreciate it and uh yeah we'll see you guys on the next video you can go check out this other video that I made about an interview question that I got asked it was really cool and it taught me actually a lot about how CPUs work you can go find that out right there see you guys", "duration(in seconds)": 425.0, "region": "US"}}

to get prayer Up Against the Cage use takedowns Tire them out these feels he can finish needs to punch his way in here pretty quick and get to work where I got him up against the cage that hurt him that hurt that's a dangerous range to be in right there I think right Patrick floors Powell Powell coming back up Paul got to get a takedown already Thomas Powell in Alex Pereira those knees are devastating well that left hook barely skimmed still did a little bit of damage Shake It Off and regroup here Oh Brother Gotta use some offense I'm thinking something thanks oh my goodness caught the kick was not able to capitalize off catching that Up Against the Cage get it to hook that leg pull it out from underneath him he's got double unders here scoop a leg and pull it out from underneath him and spin him off the cage and put him on his back just under three to go opening round Powell surviving brutal body shots and knees with the kicks and knees both well Powell's a physical specimen too Pat I mean that dude is jacked he is as strong as they come look out for that right knee he was able to uh so far survive a couple hard shots the elbow and knees that'll make you change your leg attack there yes it will hacking elbow like that creates that distance and they restart and center of the octagon in the clinch for air with another knee oh God I gotta get prayer to commit on ponchos coming back the other way to getting clean on stake down getting off his feet to the body from Powell oh I came from prayer blocked but still got through and now on his back whoever wants nothing to do with that one don't blame him a 30 left in this round oh God I stay off the cage got to be able to move backwards at any time combination Stone pal ette six foot four Alex Pereira is just a beast wear this shot from Powell follow up with the takedown there had him on his heels encapitalize on that dance that's the power holy power of Alex Pereira on full display in his Legacy Fighting Alliance debut that's experience and timing right there just gave a little bit of territory and then dropped it unbelievable drop the bomb and drop Thomas Powell the MMA world and the LFA middleweight division has officially been put on high alerts that left hook is like a bull whip that's like a bull whip literally amazing Amaze we hope Thomas Powell's able to that's a dangerous payoff and recover here I mean he felt like a ton of bricks now people will understand after seeing that why he knocked out Israel out of Samia yes sir watch how he had kick there oh just it is it's like a bull whip it comes

OF COURSE WALL STREET HAS BEEN BRACING FOR SLOWER GROWTH, LOWER EARNINGS AND A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING A RECESSION. IN FACT GOLDMAN I'LL SHOW YOU A CHART. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG NEWS ITEMS, RIGHT? THEY ARE POINTING TO TIGHTER FISCAL FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, THAT'S MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND OF COURSE REAL GDP, WE KNOW WE SAW LAST WEEK A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS SAYING HEY, GDP IS GOING TO BE LESS UNDER 1% BARELY ABOVE NOT RECESSION, ALTHOUGH, THEY ALSO RAISED THEIR RECESSION TO 12-MONTH PROBABILITY TO 45% FROM 35%, SO THEY AREN'T THE ONLY ONES BY THE WAY. YOU COULD SEE ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GDP GOING DOWN, THEY SEE A GREATER CHANCE OF RECESSION BUT NOT TO BE OUT DONE. JPMORGAN REALLY GRABBED ALL OF THE HEADLINES OVER THE WEEKEND BECAUSE THEY NOW SEE A 60% CHANCE OF RECESSION. YOU COULD SEE RECESSION AND SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT 60% RECESSION, THEY THINK THERE IS SOME RESILIENCE LEFT BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF COURSE AND OF COURSE OVER THE WEEKEND SECRETARY BESSENT SAYING THERE WON'T BE A RECESSION SO LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT. I WANT TO BRING IN FORMER NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL THEIR CHIEF ECONOMIST AND CURRENT SMBC CHIEF ECONOMIST JOE LAVONIA. JOE, TAKING A LOOK AT THE TABLE FROM JPMORGAN, IT'S REALLY REALLY SOMETHING WE CAN LEARN FROM. SO HERE THEY ARE SAYING 40% PROBABILITY WE WON'T HAVE A RECESSION BASED ON ANIMAL \n  SPIRITS, AND ANIMAL SPIRITS AND U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM ENDS. THE END OF AMERICAN EXCEPTION L AISM AND GOLDILOCKS SO THOSE THINGS ARE HANGING BY A THREAD WHICH OF COURSE COMING INTO THE YEAR WERE LIKE A TIDAL WAVE AND THEN SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? >>  IT'S A LOT OF HYPERBOLE. LOOK, THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO RESET THE ECONOMY FROM AN UNSUSTAINABLE PATH AND PEOPLE COULD DEBATE ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING ABOUT DOING IT BUT CERTAINLY, THE DEBT WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS IS ASTRONOMICAL AND THE U.S. IS ON A BAD COURSE, SO DRASTIC ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION IS STARTING TO TAKE AND MORE ACTIONS WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO SPENDING CUTS SO ON THE EXCEPTIONALISM, CHARLES I'D SAY THAT'S NOT 25, IT'S 50 SOMETHING-PLUS. BUT THEN AGAIN I LOOK AT THE GLASS AS HALF FULL. I'M NOT A NERVOUS NELLIE OR  PESSIMIST. CHARLES: I'M WITH YOU. I THINK THAT THIS IS WALL STREET COMES UP WITH THESE SORT OF THEMES. EVERYONE JUMPS ON THE BANDWAGON AND IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE IT SEEMS CONTRADICTORY ON THE CALL. EXCEPTIONALISM UNWINDS AND MISERY LOVES COMPANY SO THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL HAVE A RECESSION. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S ACTION. >>  THE THING I WANT TO SAY AGAIN IS I DO THINK GIVEN THE PRESIDENT'S NEGOTIATING SKILLS, DESPITE WHAT SOME OF THE RHETORIC IS, I EXPECT THERE TO BE A DEAL, AND BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. BEST INTEREST BUT ALSO CALMS MARKETS AND PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF THESE RECESSION ESTIMATES IS THEY SEEM TO BE STATIC MAYBE, AND THAT REFLECT THE FACT IN A FEW WEEKS OR  DAYS WHENEVER, YOU COULD HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH AND THINGS COULD RAPIDLY CHANGE AND THAT TIGHTENING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOMES A STIMULATIVE TSUNAMI. CHARLES: MARKETS SPIKED EARLIER TODAY ON A CALL ON THE INTERPRETATION THAT HASSETT HAD MADE A CALL AND ON A RIVAL NETWORK IF YOU WILL TO PUT A PAUSE ON THE 90 DAY, FOR 90 DAYS. I PERSONALLY THINK IT BE A COLOSSAL MISTAKE AND THE ULTIMATE FORM OF WEAKNESS AT THIS POINT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO PUT A PAUSE ON THIS WHEN YOU HAVE 50 NATIONS COMING TO THE TABLE, BREAKING NEWS ON JAPAN, NETANYAHU AT THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS LIKE THEY GOT MOMENTUM. >>  WELL AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T SEE THE STORY. I KNOW KEVIN, I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAID IT. CHARLES: HE DIDN'T SAY IT. IT WAS FAKE NEWS. >>  OKAY WELL THAT SORT OF EXPLAINS IT BUT LOOK THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE WILL SAY THE PROCESS SHOULD UNFOLD BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER THERE WILL BE A DEAL AND THEREFORE YES, TO CAPITULATE RIGHT NOW WOULD NOT BE PRUDENT NOR DO I EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN. CHARLES: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FED AND THEIR ROLE HERE. AGAIN, LAST WEEK, IT WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING. I UNDERSTAND THAT JAY POWELL IS MAYBE BACK WAS AGAINST THE WALL BUT JUST THE WEEK BEFORE WE HAD THE FOMC MEETING AND HE RESURRECTED THE TERM TRANSITORY AND HE MUST BELIEVE INFLATION IS TRANSITORY TO USE THAT WORD EVER AGAIN EVEN IN PRIVATE. I DON'T THINK HE SAYS IT AT HOME, BUT HE FELT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH BUT THEN OF COURSE WE HAD THE RECIPROCAL TARIFF, THAT TABLE THREW EVERYONE OFF, THE METHODOLOGY THREW A LOT OF FOLKS OFF SO HE ACKNOWLEDGED INFLATION MAY LINGER A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT OVER THE WEEKEND THEY GOT DOWN TO 1.22% INFLATION. THEY WERE AT 1.4%. I MEAN, IT SEEMS TO BE A HUGE MISTAKE IF THE FED THINKS THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SLOWING ECONOMY. >>  I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST THIS CHARLES. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT GOES INTO IT AND I'VE LOOKED AT IT. CHARLES: WHERE DO YOU THINK THOUGH IN TERMS OF INFLATION OR  SLOW ECONOMY? WHAT'S THE GREATEST THREAT RIGHT NOW TO THE ECONOMY? >>  INFLATION, AND AGAIN, WE'RE GOING THROUGH A BUDGET PROCESS THAT THE FED MIGHT TREAT AS BEING INFLATIONARY WHICH IT'S NOT, BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT TARIFFS AND THE FED DEBATING EASING THE MARKET PUSHING THE FED TO EASE I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE GOING TO EASE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S RECESSION EITHER. THE FED, IN MY OPINION, SHOULD KEEP RATES STABLE. SEE HOW THINGS PLAY OUT AND THEN IF OIL PRICES DO MOVE LOWER OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THERE IS INCREASED SUPPLY WHICH I EXPECT THE TAX CUTS ARE MADE PERMANENT, THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS PRETTY INFLATION-FRIENDLY, THE FED COULD THEN CUT AGGRESSIVELY BUT MAYBE NOT UNTIL NEXT YEAR. THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRUEFLATION CHARLES IS THE PEOPLE HIGHLIGHTING IT BEING WEAK NOW WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT IT A YEAR OR  SO AGO AND 3% DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT NUMBER EITHER. CHARLES: PRESIDENT TRUMP POSTED A STORY ABOUT OIL, JUST MENTIONED OIL AND OIL AND INTEREST RATES AND SO HE THINKS HE SAID OIL IS DOWN, INTEREST RATES ARE DOWN AND THE FED IS MOVING TOO SLOW THEY SHOULD BE CUTTING. LET'S TALK THOUGH. THERE ARE SORT OF BENEFITS. NOT EVERYONE IN AMERICA IS IN THE STOCK MARKET. IF THEY WERE WOULD WE HAVE PRESIDENT HARRIS IN OFFICE. GASOLINE PRICES MATTER MORE, FOOD PRICES MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET DID IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE MORE AMERICANS CARE ABOUT THAT DAY-TO-DAY WHEN THEY WAKE UP THAT HITS THEM IN THE FACE. NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS HAPPENING. MORTGAGES ARE COMING DOWN. THERE'S THINGS HAPPENING NOW THAT DON'T MAKE FINANCIAL NEWS BUT MAIN STREET IS PRETTY GOOD NEWS. >>  THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES OF TRUMP'S BASE CARES ABOUT CAN THEY AFFORD A MORTGAGE AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STATES WHERE YOU DRIVE A LOT SO FOOD PRICES, GAS PRICES ARE REAL BIG ISSUES SO WE DON'T WANT TO SEE AN EXTENDED BEAR MARKET IN EQUITIES WITH A NEGATIVE WEALTH EFFECT THAT LEADS HIGHER END CONSUMERS TO PULLBACK WHICH SETS IN MOTION LESS PRODUCT IN CAPEX. CHARLES: SO SHOULD THE AVERAGE PERSON SUFFER, THE AVERAGE PERSON IN AMERICA KEEP CREDIT CARD BILLS HIGH SO THE STOCK MARKET STAYS HIGH SO THE RICH PEOPLE STAY RICH? >>  THAT'S THE ISSUE, CHARLES. THIS IS WHY WE ENTERED THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WITH AN UNSUSTAINABLE BACKDROP. CHARLES: THE STOCK MARKET TAKES A HIT SHOULD THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS CARE? THE MARKET ALWAYS COMES BACK. WHY DO WE PUT THE MARKET BEFORE THE AMERICANS? >>  WE SHOULD, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING BUT AGAIN IT COMES BACK TO WHETHER THERE'S A DOWNTURN. I BELIEVE WE COULD AVOID A DOWNTURN. MY PROBABILITY IS NOT AS HIGH AS SOME OF THE OTHER SHOPS YOU SHOWED, AND IF THAT'S THE CASE EVERYBODY BENEFITS BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT. IT'S WELL-TAKEN. THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT THE PRESIDENT RAN ON AND WON ON SO EARLIER, HE'S GOING TO IMMEDIATELY BACK AWAY FROM HIS APPROACH. CHARLES: WHAT TIMELINE ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THEN? WE'VE GOT 30 SECONDS. LIKE HOW LONG SHOULD IT TAKE? TO YOUR POINT SOFT DATA CAN BECOME HARD DATA. WHERE DO WE, HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS? >>  100 DAYS IS APRIL 30. IT GOES A BIT PAST THEN IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET MAYBE BY MEMORIAL DAY WE'LL GET CLARITY AND BY THE WAY IF WE COULD AGREE ON THE BUDGET CONTOURS AND SEE WHAT THE SPENDING CUTS ARE THEN THAT MAY PIVOT BACK TO TARIFFS AND PERHAPS TARIFFS MAY NOT HAVE TO BE SO HIGH IF WE GET MORE ON THE SPENDING SIDE SO EVERYTHING TO ME IS NEGOTIATING, AND NOTHING IS SETTLED YET.

From capturing the intricate details of Jupiter's storms and Saturn's rings to the iconic \"Pale Blue Dot\" image that portrays Earth's fragile beauty, Voyager 1 has significantly expanded our understanding of the universe. Even at a staggering distance of 176 astronomical units from the Sun, it continues to communicate with Earth through the Deep Space Network.", "tags": "Voyager 1, space exploration, NASA, interstellar travel, solar system, outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, cosmic rays, Deep Space Network, Golden Record, astronomy, spacecraft, heliosphere, Pale Blue Dot, space science, astronomical units, space mission, interstellar medium, cosmic journey", "script": "On September 5th, 2027, the voyager 1 will have \nbeen officially traveling in space for 50 years. At this date, given its current speed of around \n38,000 mph, it is expected to be 176 astronomical   units or about 24 light hours away from the \nsun. However if it travels at this speed,   it would take 300 years to reach the \ninner boundary of the Oort Cloud,   and 40,000 years before it reaches another star. Nevertheless, over the next billion years, \nwhere will it travel? And what will it see? But before answering that, lets take a step back. The primary mission of Voyager 1, \nalong with its twin, Voyager 2,   was to explore the outer planets of the solar \nsystem. Voyager 1 was specifically tasked with   conducting close-up studies of Jupiter and Saturn, \ntheir moons, and their magnetic environments.  Its trajectory was designed to take it past \nJupiter in March 1979, and Saturn in November   1980. Interestingly, when it approached Jupiter, \nthe spacecraft's cameras captured intricate cloud   patterns, massive storms, and the planet's \nfaint ring system. One of the mission's most   iconic images is the detailed view of the Great \nRed Spot, which is a gigantic storm larger than   Earth. Voyager 1 also turned its attention to \nJupiter's moons. It discovered that Io is the   most volcanically active body in the solar system, \nshowing erupting volcanoes and vast lava flows. In addition, its images of Europa \nrevealed a smooth, icy surface,   hinting at the possibility of a subsurface ocean \nbeneath the moon's icy crust. A year later,   the voyager 1 reached Saturn. The spacecraft's \nimages showcased the intricate structure of   Saturn's rings, revealing countless \nringlets and gaps within the rings,   including the previously unseen F ring. \nLike with Jupiters moons, voyager 1 provided   detailed views of Saturns moons. But perhaps \nthe most significant discovery was the thick,   orange atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's \nlargest moon. The dense atmosphere,   rich in nitrogen and hydrocarbons, suggested \nthe presence of complex organic molecules. Almost a decade later in 1990, the voyager 1 \nstarted on the extended phase of its journey,   known as the Voyager Interstellar Mission, \nwhich was aimed to explore the outermost   edge of the Sun's domain, known as the \nheliosphere, and to venture beyond into   the interstellar medium. This was also where \nthe famous pale blue dot picture was taken. 8 years after this, it passed the pioneer 10, \nofficially making it the furthest man-made object. (Voyager 1 surpassed Pioneer 10 to become the \nmost distant human-made object from the Sun on   February 17, 1998. At that time, Voyager \n1 was about 69.4 astronomical units (AU)   from the Sun. An astronomical unit is the \naverage distance from the Earth to the Sun,   approximately 93 million miles (150 million \nkilometers), so Voyager 1 was about 6.4   billion miles (10.3 billion kilometers) from \nthe Sun when it achieved this milestone) - And almost 15 years later on August 25th 2012, it \ncrossed the heliopause and entered interstellar   space, providing the first direct measurements of \ncosmic rays, magnetic fields, and the density of   interstellar medium, offering interesting insights \ninto the nature of the space between the stars. The Voyager 1 maintains its communication with \nEarth through a High Gain Antenna, which is about   3.7 meters in diameter. This antenna focuses \nthe radio waves, allowing the spacecraft to   send and receive signals over the vast distances \nof space. It specifically communicates with the   Deep Space Network, which is a collection of \nlarge radio antennas located in California,   Spain, and Australia. This placement, with each \nstation positioned roughly 120 degrees apart in   longitude around the globe, ensures that as \nthe Earth rotates, at least one facility is   always in a position to maintain a line of sight \nwith any spacecraft, allowing for continuous   communication. These large dishes are capable \nof communicating with spacecrafts billions of   miles away which is how they can communicate with \nthe voyager space probes. The signals travel at   the speed of light and can take around 20 \nhours to reach Earth. This is because the   Voyager 1 uses the high-gain antennas to direct \na narrow beam of radio waves towards Earth, and   since radio waves are a form of electromagnetic \nradiation, they travel at the speed of light. The spacecraft's ability to communicate \nand operate is fueled by radioisotope   thermoelectric generators. These generators \nharness electricity from the heat released   by the decay of plutonium-238, powering \nVoyager 1's instruments, onboard computers,   and radio transmitters. The RTGs, with a half-life \nof about 87.7 years, experience a power decline   of roughly four watts annually. It is anticipated \nthat by 2025, Voyager 1 will lack sufficient power   for any scientific instrument operation. Beyond \nthis point, although Voyager 1 will continue its   silent journey through space, we will no longer \nreceive new data or signals from the spacecraft. But in any case, the Voyager 1 carries a Golden \nRecord, which is a 12-inch gold-plated copper   disk containing sounds and images selected \nto portray the diversity of life and culture   on Earth. It's a time capsule intended for any \nextraterrestrial life form or future humans who   might find it. The record includes greetings in 55 \nlanguages, music from various cultures and eras,   natural sounds of Earth, and a selection of \nimages showing life and the human condition. So how far can the voyager 1 even travel? Realistically, based on its trajectory \nand the vastness of space, the voyager   1 is far more likely to experience structural \ndegradation over time due to factors such as   micro meteoroid impacts, cosmic \nradiation, and thermal cycling,   than to be significantly affected by \nthe gravitational influence of a star or   planet. Therefore it's possible that Voyager 1's \nstructure could remain recognizable for hundreds   of millions to a few billion years, barring \nany catastrophic collisions with large objects. By this time, it will have traveled around \na quintillion miles, which is only about   1.7% of the Milky Way’s diameter, but \nit would’ve have seen numerous stars. Given its current trajectory towards the \nconstellation Ophiuchus, during its lifetime,   the voyager 1 could potentially pass \nby the constellations Hercules, Lyra,   Cygnus, Draco, and Camelopardalis. The \nnumber of stars in these constellations   could range from a thousand to tens of thousands. Its worth noting, that over billions of years, the \nspacecraft's trajectory will be influenced by many   factors, including gravitational encounters such \nas those from molecular clouds, passing stars,   or even the tidal forces from the Milky \nWay itself. As the Milky Way rotates,   its gravitational forces and those \nof nearby galaxies and interstellar   objects will subtly alter Voyager 1's \ncourse. These changes, though small   over short time scales, can accumulate \nto significant deviations over eons. Furthermore, over such vast timescales, the stars \nthemselves will have moved significantly from   their current positions, and the constellations \nas we know them, will have altered or ceased to   exist in their present forms based on new \nstars forming and old ones dying, ensuring   that the galaxy of the distant future will be \nsignificantly different from the one we see today. Given these uncertainties, predicting Voyager \n1's exact journey becomes an exercise in   probabilities rather than certainties. Its \ninteraction with the interstellar medium,   including potential encounters with dust, gas, \nand other particles, will also play a role in   its long-term trajectory and condition. The \nspacecraft may also pass through regions of   varying densities in the galaxy, from the \nrelatively sparse outer halo to potentially   denser regions nearer the galactic core, \neach with its own gravitational nuances. However, Voyager 1's journey continues \nto embody the spirit of exploration and   discovery that defines human curiosity \nas it travels the uncharted territories   of scientific knowledge and \nunderstanding of the universe.", "duration(in seconds)": 420.0, "region": "US"}}

munitions such as GBU12 Paveway 2 laserg guided bombs and JDAM joint direct attack munition smart bombs the mission was part of a coordinated air strike campaign to destroy hidden enemy weapons facilities in a remote desert region before takeoff the pilot and her ground crew underwent a detailed briefing she reviewed target maps strike scenarios and weather conditions that could affect the flight full concentration and quick decision-making were critical in this highstakes mission with clearance from the control tower her F-16 roared off from a forward deployed air base in the Middle East within minutes she reached operational altitude and began maneuvering toward the target zone using the aircraft's advanced radar and navigation systems she scanned for target coordinates communicating with escort and reconnaissance aircraft over radio she received real-time updates on enemy positions and terrain just moments before bomb release she executed evasive maneuvers to dodge potential surfaceto-air threats she then stabilized the aircraft locked onto the target using a laser targeting pod and released two precisiong guided bombs seconds felt like minutes in the air but in no time a powerful explosion erupted on the ground the target was successfully destroyed and a plume of black smoke rose high into the sky the mission wasn't over yet she continued circling the area to monitor for possible counterattacks and coordinated with other aircraft still engaged in operations overhead in a post mission interview the pilot emphasized that rigorous training and strong team support were key to success \"i'm just one small part of a big team we all work together to accomplish the mission accurately and safely,\" she said her journey as a combat pilot began years ago when she entered the USAF flight training program though initially doubted due to lingering stereotypes about female pilots she proved that discipline mental toughness and technical skill are what truly matter in the cockpit of the F-16 there is no distinction between male and female performance is measured by quick decision-m situational awareness and the ability to control the aircraft in extreme conditions and in this mission she delivered flawlessly her squadron commander praised her courage and precision describing the operation as one of the cleanest and most effective air strikes in recent months back at the base she was greeted with applause and warm embraces from her fellow airmen not only did she return safely but she also secured a critical victory for the mission this operation stood as a powerful symbol of the growing role of women in modern military forces from pilots to technicians women are increasingly recognized and respected within the US military structure in every training and mission female pilots like her often feel they have to work twice as hard to earn recognition but she never complains i chose this path and I will walk it with all my heart she affirmed with an ever growing flight log she has become a role model for aspiring female aviators she also takes part in mentoring programs to help guide new cadets at the Air Force Academy her success in precision bombing demonstrates how advanced technology like targeting systems and smart munitions reach their full potential when operated by highly skilled pilots the involvement of female pilots in strategic air operations has broadened the US military's vision of building an inclusive and high-performance force they're not just supporting elements they are frontline warriors in modern combat looking ahead she is committed to continuously sharpening her skills she believes that every mission carries a profound responsibility that must be approached with professionalism and integrity and for many she now stands as an inspiring figure who proves the sky is not the limit but the beginning of limitless possibilities her achievements have not gone unnoticed beyond the air base military leaders and policymakers have cited her performance as an example of the evolving role of women in combat and the importance of diversity in leadership and frontline roles her story has even begun to circulate among defense circles as a case study in operational excellence and gender integration in interviews with her fellow squadron members many expressed admiration for her calm demeanor under fire and sharp tactical thinking \"she doesn't flinch,\" \"Even when we're flying into high threat zones,\" said one of her wingmen \"that kind of confidence inspires the rest of us to stay sharp when not flying missions.\" She dedicates time to training simulations and mission planning she also advocates for better outreach to young women interested in military aviation often speaking at recruitment events and high schools to encourage the next generation of pilots her experience also contributes to refining operational doctrine after each mission she participates in debriefs where pilots discuss what went right what went wrong and how to improve her insights often drawn from the unique perspective she brings have helped shape more agile and adaptive air strike strategies as her career advances she hopes to one day lead a combat squadron \"i want to pay it forward,\" she said \"i was given an opportunity to fly and fight for my country and now I want to make sure others get that same chance no matter their background or gender [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 484.0, "region": "US"}}

Boeing's newly revealed F47 6th gen fighter jet because I thought it would be fun to speculate about some neat near future sci-fi tech it might have i won't be going over every sci-fi plane tech though because it's unlikely to have stuff like the magic thought control from Firefox but it may just be equipped with lasers like lots of things in Ace Combat have had for many years now jet engines do produce a tremendous amount of power that could be tapped to run a laser weapon though most likely one just for defensive purposes it would be there to shoot down incoming missiles and such like the one the Medusa has in nuclear option the question is whether that's actually practical considering you need optics and a way to point a thing like a turret or something which wouldn't be particularly stealthy maybe something with a very small arc of fire peeking through a window but eh a better fit would be a phased array laser which would be flat yet still able to point its beam all over the place but those things are tech kind of far off having since you need nano scale optics and such i talked more about phased array lasers in this video here if you're interested the other route with lasers is to go full ace combat and have it be a forward-fixed weapon like the gun that fighters carry but such a laser would have to be ludicrously powerful for that to do anything in the brief moments it would actually be pointed at a target it's just easier to have an actual gun for that job so the F-47 is probably just going to have one of those rather than a laser but it would be technically possible to include the latter i guess it could have a microwave weapon based on its main radar but would it be used for more than just electronic warfare stuff i don't know its main weapon is going to be longrange missiles and such fired from an integrated stealthy weapon bay though probably not one like the jets in the movie Stealth use with the crazy revolver selector thing it looks really cool and is actually similar to something many bombers have but real integrated weapons bays on stealth fighters work a bit differently payloads are solidly mounted inside and the bays work by opening pushing out a missile and closing as fast as they possibly can this limits the amount of time the unsty interior of the bay is exposed for which is kind of important for a craft that's not meant to be seen another one of the ideas I've seen around is that the F-47 may use aerero elastic control but what is this we've all seen how wings bend up when they create lift but there are other ways and directions for wings and control surfaces to move and bend under these forces things like induced vibration reduction of control or even reversal of a control surface can happen and these are all kind of bad so aircraft are built to limit or prevent these things from happening just like how aerodynamic instability can be harnessed to actually improve aircraft maneuverability with the aid of computer controls aerero elastic twist can also be used in this manner the X53 demonstrator actually tested this in the early 2000s installing a lighter more flexible wing and split leading edge flaps onto a pre-production FA18 a computer used the control services to deliberately twist that more flexible wing to turn what were previously negative impacts into positive ones getting more roll control out of a more lightweight component win-win i'm not sure if this tech ended up being applied to any current production craft but it is apparently applicable to lots of kinds of aircraft like the lambda wing seen in stealth bombers and some UAVs so it's possible it's used but we just don't know about it interesting tech by itself but the real sci-fi stuff comes by combining it with the related concept of the adaptive compliant wing which is basically flexible control services like these flex foil morphing wings these are intended to eliminate all the little gaps and seams that can increase drag and reduce efficiency but to my eye it seems like that smooth shaping would fit very nicely onto a stealth plane and the makers of the movie Stealth apparently agreed since look bendy control services on the Eddie Ukav that the movie actually refers to as being aerero elastic the question is would these bendy services be a real thing on a new jet the B-21 Raider is designed to be super stealthy but as we can see from its test flights its control services are the same tech as always based on the Raider it would make sense that the F-47 would likely just have normal control services too but look at its cannards there's no seam between them and the fuselage what if they bend and curve instead we know the flex foil tech is many years old so could have been integrated with stealth coatings and the like by now but on the other hand this is an artist's impression that could be just low detail and new tech like this is expensive something the F47 is supposedly trying to avoid the next big tech thing the F-47 is actually quite likely to have is the ability to work in concert with armed drone fighters the technical term for this is manned unmanned teaming or collaborative combat aircraft but you may have heard it go by the term loyal wingman referring to the idea that a plane flown by a person would always have backup from its robotic followers one way to think of them is in terms of being a detached extension of the lead aircraft carrying more sensors and weapons for it to deploy as needed think back to the thing about limiting how long weapons bays are open for a stealthcraft and imagine how much more useful it would be to have the weapons bay on a different plane entirely you can see why everyone is trying to make these things work and sci-fi is chock full of all sorts of similar things be they drones or full AI i want to highlight the ones seen in the movie Stealth and the Ace Combat franchise the first is pretty much all about this idea though the AI Eddie with his super extra high-tech jet is more intended to eventually replace the flesh and blood pilot he's teamed up with the movie also has some musings about if drones are suitable for this role and if it's worth having pilots still present to make moral choices even if they're in harm's way but it's kind of muddled in with a weird plot about the AI gaining sentience from a lightning bolt like it's Johnny 5 and consequently turning into an edgy teen with airto ground missiles and yes there's also the discussion about drones and AI in real life but that's beyond the scope of this video ace Combat has its own take on it ai planes have been a staple of the franchise since the second installment but Seven went allin with drones and AI being a huge part of the story and gameplay there's the annoyingly agile little drones you fight throughout the game but also the big super duper flying drone carriers are themselves also remotely operated drone craft in the later levels there's also normal jets with AI replacement pilots that very much play the part of the loyal wingman backing up flesh and blood pilots though they are not quite as capable as them that does not apply to the two end bosses of the game though the two AI ravens Huggin and Munan who are both smart capable opponents and they're dangerous because they just carry on with their programmed orders despite them not being relevant anymore what else might the F-47 have well one trend in some upcoming jets like the Chinese one seen flying around last December seems to be going for a tailless design forgoing the vertical empanage to make the plane nice and flat improves stealth and range though maybe at the cost of some agility but look at this thing the X36 from the late '90s this was a subscale prototype specifically designed to see if a craft that was both tailless and agile could work and it worked well thanks to its cannards and oh look the F47 has those too i find it interesting that to my knowledge at least there's actually not all that many tailless fictional fighters there's a few around here and there like the ones we've very conveniently mentioned already in this video but they're definitely rare compared to how futuristic they feel i don't know just an interesting observation that's sure to change if these sixth generation jets end up being tailless i hope you enjoyed this look at some of the techs out there that might be included on the F47 some are certainly a lot more likely than others but it's also interesting to see how fiction may or may not have used some of them already and to think about how future creations will be inspired by this new jet you can support Space Talk by joining our Patreon where you can get our frigate and space

That’s because \nI did all this with no Computer Science degree or   bootcamp. I made countless mistakes along the \nway which made my path to become a Software   Engineer longer than it should have been. \nI watched countless Youtube tutorials, paid   for numerous Udemy courses and spent hundreds of \nhours learning things that didn’t add any value.   If I could go back in time and undo \nall the things that don’t work,   I would be in the exact same situation as \ntoday within 6 months of starting programming.   That’s exactly why I made this video. Today, \nI'll remove all the useless fluff and give   you the fastest path to go from a beginner to \na full-time Software Engineer.  Before I begin, there are 3 major mistakes that \ncan slow down your progress to become a full-time   Software Engineer. I will also share these 3 \nmistakes along the way. So, stay tuned for that. As a new programmer, the first decision you \nneed to make is “Which programming language to   learn?”. To answer that question, let’s talk about what \na beginner wants from a programming language.   Number 1, The language should be easy and \nintuitive to write. It should not require   learning very complex syntax. It should be \nas close as possible to writing in English.   Next, The programming language should be versatile \nand have many applications. As a beginner,   you don’t want to learn a new language for every \nnew project you want to build. In other words,   the language should have great returns \nfor the time you invest on learning it.   Lastly, the programming language should be \nfast to write. You shouldn’t have to waste time   spelling out the declaration of a new variable or \nsimple iteration through a list. In other words,   it should be concise and get the job done in \nminimum lines of code. As some of you might have   already guessed it, Python is the language that \nsolves all these problems. It’s almost   as easy as writing in English. It has so many \ndifferent applications like Web development, Data   Science and Automation. Python is extremely fast to write when compared with other popular languages.  That's because it requires less lines of code for the  same amount of code. As an example, here is the same code \nwritten in Java vs Python. For me personally, I started   out with learning Java. I used to do all my coding \ninterviews in Java. Recently, I switched to using   Python and it improved my interview performance \nby at least 2 times because it’s so fast to write.   Having said that, Java and other popular \nlanguages have their own advantages and you will   have to learn another language at some point \nin your career. But   I do believe that Python would be \nthe best language to start with. Now that we know we should learn Python, let’s \ntalk about how to do it. And this is where most   new programmers make the first major mistake that \nslows them down. The mistake most beginners make   is that they learn by watching others code. Let \nme explain this by telling you how most people   learn programming. Most newbies would go to a \ncourse provider like Udemy and look up for Python   courses. Then they pick one of these 20+ hours \ncourses thinking that these courses are long and   detailed and hence good for them. And then they \nnever end up finishing the course. That’s because   20 hours of content is not the same as 20 hours \nof great content. Some people will go to Youtube   and watch someone else code without ever writing \nany code themselves. And watching these tutorials   gives them a false sense of progress. That’s \nbecause coding in your head is very different   from actually writing down the code and debugging \nthe errors. So, what is the right way to do it?   The answer is very simple, you should Learn by \nCoding. For this, you can go to this free website   called learnpython.org. On this website, just \nfocus on the basic lessons for Python and don’t   worry about Data Science tutorials or any Advanced \ntutorials. That's because even if you   learn advanced concepts right now, you would not \nbe able to remember them until you have actually   applied them on a real world problem. You can \nalways come back to learn the advanced concepts in   the future when you need them for your projects. \nIf you look at a lesson, each lesson first explains a basic concept   and then asks you to apply those concepts to a \nproblem. Feel free to play with the sample code.   Think about other problems you can solve with \nconcepts you just learnt and try to solve them   in the exercise portion. Once you’re done with the \nbasics, you’re good to move on to the next steps. In the spirit of learning by coding, we would do \nsome projects in Python next. In the beginning,   it’s very hard to do something on your own. \nSo, we’ll take the help of experts. So,   go to Youtube and look up this video called “12 \nbeginner Python projects” by freecodecamp.org,   which by the way is a great \nchannel to follow. In this video,   they build 12 beginner Python projects from \nscratch. These projects include building Madlibs,   Tic Tac toe, Minesweeper etc. and all of them \nare very interesting. They walk you through   the implementation of all these projects step \nby step making it very easy to follow. But,   before you start watching this tutorial, there \nare 2 things you should know. One, You should   not watch this tutorial casually. Follow along if \nyou really want to learn programming and become a   Software Engineer. To follow along, you would \nneed something called Integrated Development   Environment or IDE to build these projects. IDE \nin simplest terms is an application where you can   write and run your code. There are several popular \nIDEs for Python. This tutorial uses VS code. So,   you might want to download VS code and set it \nup for Python before starting on this tutorial. Once you have completed this tutorial, you \nare ready to work on your own projects.   Working on building your own projects will \nhelp you in multiple ways. Number one,   it will introduce you to how Software Engineers \nwork in the real world. You will write code that   will fail and you’ll debug it and repeat it \nover and over again. This is exactly what   a day in the life of a Software Engineer looks \nlike. Number two, you will build a portfolio   of projects by doing this. You can host your \ncode on Github and put the link in your resume.   This will help you attract recruiters and get \nyour resume shortlisted. Lastly, building your   own projects will give you confidence that you \nare ready to tackle new challenges as a Software   Engineer. But, what kind of projects should you work on?  You can think of any projects that you \nfind interesting but here are some examples I found. You can build a Web crawler, or an Alarm clock, or maybe an app that gives you Wikipedia article of the day.  Some example projects that   I built were a Spam filter, an Algorithmic \nTrading engine and an e-commerce website. Now you have a great resume and you are \nconfident about your programming skills.   Let’s start applying for Software Engineer \npositions. Wait a second. This is actually the second   major mistake new programmers make.  You see, in an ideal world, having good programming skills and a great resume is all you should need to   become a Software Engineer. But unfortunately for us, tech companies like to play games with   us in the interviews. They ask you specific kinds \nof programming questions in the interviews. If you   don’t prepare for these questions, you might not \nget the expected results. So,   let’s see how to prepare for interviews. All the \ninterviews are based on this one course that is   taught to all Computer Science graduates. This \ncourse is called Data Structures and Algorithms.   Fortunately for us, Google has created this course \nand made it available for free on Udacity. And the   best part is that this course is taught in \nPython. In this four week course, you’ll learn   about different algorithms related to searching \nand sorting. You’ll learn about data structures   like maps, trees and graphs. Don’t worry if you \ndon’t know any of these terms right now. I am   sure that by the end of this course, you’ll be \na pro. For that just keep 2 things in mind . One,   be regular and finish this course. As I mentioned \nearlier, most people start courses and never   finish them. So, make sure you take small steps \neveryday and make regular progress. Two,   make sure you complete all the exercises they give \nin this course. As I have already said many times,   the only way to learn coding is by doing. So, \nimplement the algorithms by yourself if you can   and finish all the assignments. Trust me when \nI say this. When it comes to interviewing for   entry level jobs, this course is the only \ndifference between you and someone who dropped   more than a hundred thousand dollars on a computer \nscience degree. So, if you finish this course,   you’ll be pretty much on par with someone \nwho has a CS degree when you interview. After completing this course on Data Structures \nand Algorithms, you have all the foundational   knowledge you need to tackle the interviews. In \norder to sharpen your interview skills further,   you need to practice some questions that have been \nasked by tech companies in the past. For that,   you should use a website called Leetcode. On \nleetcode, you will get interview style questions.   You can write your code and test your solution \nright there on the website. Leetcode is great for   beginners because all the questions are tagged \neasy, medium or hard based on difficulty level.   If you buy a premium subscription of the website, \nyou can also filter the questions by the tech   company that asked them in the past interviews.\nYou should start with easy questions and keep   working on them until you can solve them in \n45 minutes. Once that happens, you can move   on to medium questions.When you start solving \nmediums in 45 minutes, you can start applying   for Software Engineering jobs. If you are lucky, \nyou will get the job right away. For most people,   it will be a process full of disappointment \nand rejections. And this is where they   make the third and the biggest mistake of all, \nThey quit. The main reason people give up early   is because they overthink and complicate the \ninterview process. After every rejection,   they replay the interview over and over in their \nhead to figure out why they failed and take every   rejection personally. To avoid this, stay inside \nyour circle of control and try to influence the   outcome of your interviews but never get tangled \nin the things you can’t control. In other words,   do your best to crack the interviews but try to \nbe detached from the outcome of the interviews. If   you want to learn about how I became a Software \nEngineer without a Computer Science degree,   watch this video at the top. If you \nwant to see my 5 year coding journey in 5 minutes,   you can watch this other video. \nI will see you in the next one.", "duration(in seconds)": 530.0, "region": "US"}}

So over the last several weeks, we have\nseen and I know some of these indicators are a bit special, but we've seen the\nnumber of people who are going to movie theaters, number of people going to\nBroadway shows. If you look at the TSA data for how many\npeople fly in airplanes, even if you look at how many people are visiting the\nStatue of Liberty here in New York City, all of that has actually started to\nweaken. And now we get another soft data point\nhere and with the Michigan sentiment for consumers.\nSo overall, it is still a little bit too early.\nBut given that we have this wait and see situation, both for consumers and for\ncorporates, it does make sense that the soft data should eventually begins to\nspill over to at least some weakening in the hot data.\nOne feature of this cycle I think a lot of people underestimated you, not\nincluded, is the resilience of this economy.\nWhat is our capacity to absorb shocks now?\nIs that been reduced? Well, that's a very important question\nbecause that depends on the nature of the sharks.\nAnd we're facing two sharks at the moment, namely those which is laying off\ngovernment workers. Estimates suggest that that will be\naround 300,000 workers that might be losing their jobs.\nRemember that for every federal worker, there are two contractors, according to\nBrookings. So Brookings studies show that in total,\ntrue employment in the federal government is roughly around 19 million\npeople. So if you now think about total number\nof households, that's 130 million. And someone in a federal worker, a\ncontractor lives together with someone in the private sector, you get that as\nmuch as ten, 15% of all households in some way or another is being impacted\nfrom a sentiment perspective by those alone.\nAnd tariffs, of course, also in particular, that impacts anyone who's\nassociated with trade with Canada and Mexico.\nAnd you have that that is also a particular, of course, across the border\nto the north and to the south, playing a significant role in a number of states.\nSo the bottom line is it's not only tariffs and trade war, it's also the\ncombination of the risk that government workers and contractors potentially lose\ntheir jobs that are the main reasons why this soft data is weakening the way it\nis. And it's not only consumers of data is\nalso corporate. If you look at the CapEx planning from\nthe regional events, Dallas Fed, Philadelphia Fit, New York Fed, that's\nshowing that businesses in those districts are saying we're beginning to\ncut backs, Cap explains. Likewise, NFIB also roundtable surveys.\nCapEx planning is also moving lower. So both consumer confidence, when we\nlower corporate confidence moving lower, it is a precursor for a slowdown coming\nin the hot data. There's an argument being made that if\nwhat was propping up the United States economy was government spending, it\nwasn't that strong to begin with. And this is actually somewhat of a\nwithdrawal from a sugar high, from an incredible amount of fiscal spend in the\ndirect aftermath of the pandemic. Do you buy that?\nThere is some truth to that detox argument in the sense that if you look\nat hiring in non-farm payrolls over the last two years, 25% of jobs created in\n2023 and 24 were government jobs. The previous year, it was like five,\n10%, much, much less. So a very significant part of jobs in\nthe last two years have been coming from the government sector.\nSo it is true that job growth has been slowing in the private sector, even\ngoing in to these shocks that we're looking at at the moment heading into\n2025. You are pretty clear that you think that\nthe inflationary shock was going to be maintained and that it was going to\ncreate a real problem for the Fed to actually offer a response to that kind\nof weakness in the economy. Do you continue to see that even though\nthe shocks that we're seeing right now to policy might have a bigger\nramification on growth than you had previously expected?\nWell, the real challenge is that going into tariffs, we had that inflation,\nunfortunately was still too high at around 3%.\nAnd most calculations suggest that you will add roughly half a percentage point\nto capacity as a result of tariffs. So it makes a huge difference where you\nstart. If you start with inflation at three and\nyou add half a percent. Of course, the risk is that you will\nhave too much upside and we're way above the Fed's target.\nWhereas if inflation had started at one and a half, which is where we were in\n2016 and you add half a percent, then inflation would move up towards the\nFed's target. So the problem was really that the\nstarting point for inflation when these policies came along was that it was\nunfortunately well above the Fed's target.\nSo the risk is in this situation that you have inflation moving higher and\ngrowth slowing down, which of course is a definition of a stagflation era shock.\nWe were talking to Mohamed El-Erian earlier this week, and he made the point\nthat given these dual shocks, the Fed should probably allow inflation to run a\nlittle bit hotter for a longer period of time and address the growth issues and\ncut rates at least once this year. Do you agree that that's more prudent at\na time where there are these stagflation area forces starting to loom?\nAbsolutely, because the Fed has the dual mandate.\nOn the one side, if growth is slowing, is saying the Fed should be cutting, if\ninflation is going up, is saying the Fed to be hiking, I think the Fed will look\nat if growth stops as low and if we're where the next several weeks begin to\nsee that unemployment begins to go up. Let's not forget that non-farm payroll\nis always done in the week of the 12th means this week.\nSo this is the week when they do the survey for the.\nAnd if we do believe that this week was somewhat intense on the policy front,\nthen there is, of course, a change that nonfarm payrolls for March could be on\nthe weaker side. And if that's the case, then in the next\nseven weeks in particular, going into April and with the April 2nd deadline\nalso from Trump with a reciprocal as tariffs, we come to the conclusion that\nthe risk is that we might begin to see growth slowed down.\nAnd the Fed will say, well, as long as inflation expectations are anchored,\nyes, actual inflation may be higher, but if inflationary pressures are anchored,\nthey will be focusing on growth slowing down and therefore the risks are that\nmarkets will be pricing in more cuts at the time.\nAnd by the way, it looks like from stock markets that they are almost saying,\nwell, the Fed should be cutting many more times, whereas rates markets are\nsaying, no, no, we only need two more cuts.\nSo there's almost an inconsistency between the messaging from stocks that\nare now in correction territory and rates markets saying, no, no, we only\nneed two more cuts in the news conference on March 19th next Wednesday\nas Chairman Powell addressed those issues.\nWhat are you looking for? So I'm looking very much for how much\nhe's focusing on this off data slowing down.\nHe did do that at the US MPF last Friday here in New York City where he was in\nhis prepared remarks saying everything is generally okay.\nBut when he was sitting down with Anurag Kashyap and ask questions, he was more\nsaying, Hey, something is going on that has some downside risks that we maybe\nshould be putting more weight on. So I do think that he will begin to talk\nabout, well, there's softness in the soft data, but maybe we're also worried\nabout softness in the hot data. We have seen this incremental shift from\nthe November meeting into December. We don't assume, we don't guess, we\ndon't speculate. Then in December, there was some\nassumption, some guessing, some speculation.\nAnd then I agree with you, the recent address we had from Chairman Powell,\nthere was another subtle shift just started to tackle policy issues head on\nin a way he hadn't done in the previous few months.\nAnd on some level, he kind of has to because there is a sort of scenario\nanalysis that has to come from the Fed for them to even be relevant about how\nthey're measuring some of these aspects. And that's probably why the statement of\neconomic projections, which could be a dart board but is sort of a messaging\ntool about how they're going to potentially respond to what is\ntranspiring and policy and how is transpiring in data, even if it doesn't\nnecessarily come to full pass. The difference now, I guess, is we're\nactually getting the policy. They don't have to speculate about it\nanymore. But that policy comes with a lot of\nvolatility. And so and they've got to manage\ninterest rates through the cycle. Maybe Chairman Powell steps down in the\nnext couple of years. I imagine he will.\nI don't know for sure, but I think we all think he will.\nI want to understand from that perspective, you sit there and you\nacknowledge the risk right now, but also you've got to think about tax cuts, the\npotential for looser regulation further down the road.\nHow do you manage through the cycle with that in mind?\nWell, that's why this debate about is it policy dependent, is it data dependent,\nbecomes really, really important because, of course, the policy that's in\nplace suggests that, well, so far the two things that we have seen from the\nbeginning is those which is putting the unemployment rate up and also\nterrorists, which is pushing inflation up.\nSo if that's the case, they need to deal with that shock as the first thing, even\nas you say, if there are other policies coming on deregulation and lower taxes\nand potentially also more energy production.", "duration(in seconds)": 479.0, "region": "US"}}

the global markets you know this is after US President Donald Trump announced and then paused his tariffs while implementing even more on uh China now there were some of the biggest falls and rises on the share markets in decades with Australian stocks at the mercy of international uncertainty the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Handra Mckela says Australian businesses will be affected uh obviously uh it has been a tumultuous uh week we've seen the volatility uh on global financial uh markets i think the big issue for Australian industry and for Australian exporters uh now is not so much the 10% tariff that's been applied on Australian exports to the United States but it's the prospect of a protracted uh trade confrontation between the United States and China uh obviously um you know the China is Australia's biggest trading partner that's not going to change anytime soon the United States is very important uh if those two economies uh are at each other's throats then it has major implications which can knock on uh to the Australian economy and tell us about those implications the real world implications for mom and dad well look I think it's going to you know um potentially flow um through throughout industry and throughout the economy um China is our major market of course uh it's very important in terms of a range of our commodities uh exports and also a major source of supplies into Australia so look if we see um you know uh growth um slowing in the United States and in China then that will have uh reverberations uh you know through into our economy to the exports that we sell uh you know whether it will have an impact on global inflation or not certainly in the US uh and in China one would have to expect that those higher prices that they will pay will have an impact uh uh whether that flows through into the rest of the world remains to be seen andrew one of the things that President Trump has said here is he wants uh industry manufacturing back in the US now we can't send the cows over there but is there any danger that Australian businesses or Australianbased businesses might move some of their operations to America well I think uh that's something that's uh got to be assessed over the longer term and I think it will be on a a range of different factors we have a significant level of investment uh in the United States uh but one thing that I think uh everyone should bear in mind here it's uh I think very unlikely um you know to borrow a phrase from others that uh any country uh can tax its way to prosperity um and effectively that's what you know raising tariffs is it's raising taxes uh we've seen it in the past uh that attempts you know to uh you know bring manufacturing back by raising tariffs uh there are very few examples where this has succeeded so I think that is uh unlikely um you know the risk is that in fact what it will do is thwart investment the one thing I would say though uh is there are other policies that the Trump administration may pursue so for example it is on their agenda to cut things like company tax uh again so in the future you know if they try to make their economy more competitive more attractive to investment through things like that then you know maybe that will have an impact andrew is there much more the Australian government could have done or should do uh to help Australian businesses in this situation well I think uh up to this point uh what we've seen the Australian government doing uh really is as much as could be expected and and in terms of the outcome that's been achieved so to be on the lowest rung at 10% uh in that uh announcement on the 2nd of April um you know honestly I think that represented the fact that we have uh a very deep uh economic and trading relationship uh with the United States we are trusted partners we are trusted allies uh the government uh working with business I think put uh every representation uh that it could uh in that process uh obviously where we go from here um if tariffs remain on that sort of baseline 10% for everybody else I think there is a good argument that we should be pressing that the United States uh restores zero tariffs to Australian uh exports into the uh into the US um we've been a reliable trading partner we have a free trade agree agreement um that's uh the rate that we're applying uh to US imports into Australia uh so we would expect that that would be what should apply uh in the near future again going back to the United States we're in the middle of an election campaign labour has said they'd like the minimum wage to be increased more than the rate of inflation uh if that went ahead what effect would that have well look what we've put forward is uh a submission which says that the uh minimum wage should go up by 2 and a half% um we should also remember that of course superanuation the superanuation guarantee will go up again by another half a percent from 1 July so we think that's a fair uh reasonable and responsible uh increase in minimum wages it would maintain the real value of minimum wages at the level that they currently are uh we don't think there's a case uh to go uh well beyond that we've seen the ACTU the unions pushing a claim for 4.5% uh honestly we think that makes it very hard particularly for smaller and medium-sized businesses in the Australian economy uh you know I think 2 and a half% is fair there are some sectors you know uh restaurants cafes hospitality retail they're real really still struggling um and uh certainly uh that would put a lot of pressure on some of those businesses", "duration(in seconds)": 384.0, "region": "US"}}

THERE ARE SOME  ALLEVIATING FACTOR. SARAH,  LET'S BRING IN ERIC JOHNSON,  SENIOR ECONOMIST  VICE-PRESIDENT ECONOMICS BMO  CAPITAL MARKETS. IT'S GREAT TO  SEE YOU BY YOUR CALCULATIONS  ARE STATSCAN'S NUMBERS. OUR  EXPORTS OF AUTOS AUTO PARTS IS  ABOUT 2.6% OF GDP. YEAH, SO  JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER 3% OF  OUR GDP. SO WHEN YOU LOOK PAST  OIL AND GAS WOULD BE, WHICH  WOULD BE THE PREDOMINANT  CATEGORY OF CANADA'S EXPORTS,  UNITED STATES, IT'S, YOU KNOW,  THE NEXT BIGGEST CATEGORY OF  EXPORTS THERE. SO CERTAINLY A  MEANINGFUL COMPONENT YOU KNOW,  WHAT WE'RE SENDING ABROAD HERE  AND PARTICULAR WHEN YOU 0 IN  ON THAT, YOU KNOW,  MANUFACTURING OR NON ENERGY  PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTION. AND  IT'S, IT'S ABOUT 2 AND A HALF  PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL ECONOMIC  OUTPUT.  >> ALSO UP AS WE'RE JUST  LOOKING AT GDP. SO WHAT YOU  WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR  IS EXPORTS AREN'T ON WHAT'S  KNOWN AS A VALUE ADDED BASIS  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE IMPORT  THINGS FROM THE UNITED STATES.  WE IMPORT THINGS FROM MEXICO  THAT THEN GOING TO A FINAL  VEHICLE THAT WE SAY, YOU KNOW,  IS SHIPPED TO UNITED STATES.  SO IF YOU GO ON TO GDP BASIS,  WHICH DOES SORT OF FACTOR IN  THAT THERE'S INPUT COSTS  EMBEDDED IN THOSE EXPORTS.  IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNDER ONE  PERCENT OF OUR GDP OVER ALSO  JUST AROUND 7.8%, DEPENDING  WHAT WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT  EMPLOYMENT OVERALL IN THIS  COUNTRY ALREADY PAY SO IT'S  LESS THAN ONE PERCENT BY THAT  MEASURE OUR TOTAL, THAT  ECONOMY, THE STRAY. THESE ALSO  DAV RETIRE OF THREATENED A  HAMMER BLOW COUNTRY ECONOMY.  >> YEAH, SO I THINK, YOU KNOW,  YES, IT IS A SMALLER SEGMENT  OF THE OVERALL IN CANADA, BUT  YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, IT'S AN  INDUSTRY THAT ONE IS VERY  CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN PARTS  OF THIS COUNTRY. SO NO  SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO IN PLACES  LIKE WINDSOR, YOU KNOW,  WOODSTOCK, CAMBRIDGE, LONDON  OSHAWA, THEY'RE MUCH BIGGER  PARTICIPANTS IN THIS INDUSTRY.  AND THEN WHAT YOU WANT TO  THINK OF AS WELL AS YOU KNOW,  THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER  ANCILLARY AND LINK SUPPLIERS  AT, YOU A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE  OF MAYBE THE DIRECT  MEASUREMENT OF THAT SECTOR,  YOU KNOW, EVEN AND SIMPLE  EXAMPLE WOULD BE, YOU KNOW,  LUMINANCE DEAL IS A REALLY BIG  INPUT PROVIDER TO OUR  AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR. AND THEY'RE  ALSO FACING THEIR OWN KIND OF  ADDITIONAL SECTORAL TARIFFS  HERE. AND SO GIVES YOU A SENSE  THAT, YES, MAYBE JUST ON THE,  YOU KNOW, SMALL ERS KIND OF  OVERALL LIKE ZOOMED OUT  MEASUREMENT. IT DOES MAYBE  LOOK LIKE A SMALLER FRACTION  OF THE ECONOMY WITH THERE'S  GOING TO BE SOME NO BIGGER  IMPLICATIONS OF THIS. ONE WAY  TO THINK OF THIS FROM AN  EMPLOYMENT PERSPECTIVE. SO  STAFF CAN HAS AN ESTIMATE  WHERE THEY LOOK AT THE  EMBEDDED JOBS IN OUR EXPORTS,  UNITED STATES AND YOU KNOW,  OVER 160,000 JOBS FROM MOTOR  VEHICLE AND PARTS ARE EMBEDDED  IN OUR EXPORTS, UNITED STATES  CRUDE. SO GET YOUR FLAVOUR,  YOU KNOW, NOT ALL OF THOSE  EXPORTS ARE GOING TO DISAPPEAR  WITH THESE TARIFFS, CERTAINLY,  BUT DOES COULD KIND OF ISSUE  SOME OF THE TABLE STAKES YEAR  OF, YOU KNOW, THE POTENTIAL  FURLOUGHS OR LAYOFFS. WE COULD  BE LOOKING AT IF THESE TARIFFS  REMAIN IN PLACE FOR SOME TIME  AND THERE IS SOME LITTLE BIT  OF A BREAK HAIR ON THEIR  VEHICLES THAT CURRENT TO MEET  THE REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT.  ROSE KUZMA BEING THE CARTER  CHAT.  >> FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT,  THE REPLACEMENT TO CAPTAINS  WHO HAVE NAFTA TARIFFS WILL  ONLY GO ON THE NON AMERICAN  CONTENT OF THE VEHICLES.  EXACTLY. SO I THINK YOU'RE,  YOU'RE GETTING AT SOME OF THE  CHALLENGE WITH THIS IS  THERE'S, YOU KNOW, JUST A  WHOLE LAYER OF DETAIL AND  NUANCE THAT GOES INTO, YOU  KNOW, I THINK TRYING TO THINK  ABOUT THE NORTH AMERICAN AUTO  SECTOR HAS 3 DIFFERENT  INDUSTRIES WHEN REALLY IT IS  ONE. AND SO YES, I THINK THE  PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED THIS  YESTERDAY. AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE  GETTING THE BEST OF AN  OTHERWISE BAD DEAL. AND YOU  KNOW, OUR ESTIMATES OR ROUGHLY  THAT ABOUT 50% OF THE CONTENT  OF THE CANADIAN VEHICLE WOULD  BE YOU KNOW, WITH US CONTENT.  SO, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'D BE  FACING SOMETHING LIKE 50% OF  THAT EFFECTIVE 25% TARIFF OR  12 AND A HALF PERCENT. BUT YOU  KNOW, JUST TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER  EXAMPLE, IF ANYONE'S AT HOME  WANTS TO, YOU KNOW, GO OUT TO  THEIR VEHICLE AND OPENED THE  DOOR. THERE IS A LITTLE POST  ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR THAT  WILL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, WHAT  THE DOMESTIC CONTENT OF THAT  VEHICLE IS ACCORDING TO THE,  YOU KNOW, AUTOMOBILE, THE  AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE LABELLING  ACT AND IT ACTUALLY ISN'T  GOING DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE  CAN IN THE U.S. CONTENT TO  LABEL THEM AS AND SO IT GETS  TO SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES OF  TRYING TO UNRAVEL THIS VERY  INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN  RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE WITH OUR  PARTNERS TO THE SOUTH HERE,  BOTH IN CANADA, BOTH IN THE  UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. AND  SO IT SPEAKS TO, YOU KNOW,  IT'S NOT JUST A SIMPLE  EXERCISE TO CALCULATE, YOU  KNOW, WHAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO  BE LIKE TO PUT TARIFFS INTO  PLACE. AND IT'S ONE OF THE  REASONS WHY I THINK, YOU KNOW,  IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ITSELF,  IT'S SORT OF DELAY THE IDEA OF  APPLYING THOSE USMCA COMPLIANT  PART TERRACE UTIL THEY FIGURE  OUT A PROCESS OF ACTUALLY HOW  TO DO THIS.  >> WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SLIGHT  DEFICIT ON LIGHT VEHICLES AND  AUTO PARTS WITH AMERICA ARE  LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT 2 BILLION  DOLLARS US SO IF YOU LOOK AT  THE OVERALL MOTOR VEHICLE  EXPORTS, WE DO HAVE A LITTLE  BIT OF A SURPLUS. THE UNITED  STATES WE EXPORT, YOU KNOW, A  LITTLE BIT A MILLION VEHICLES  TO THE U.S.. WE IMPORT AROUND  630,000 VEHICLES FROM THE U.S.  TO CANADA LAST YEAR. BUT WHEN  YOU INCLUDE PARTS THERE,  IMMEDIATELY THE U.S. GOES INTO  A TRADE SURPLUS THERE WITH US.  AND SO AGAIN, YOU KNOW, TRADE  SURPLUSES HERE, I DON'T THINK  THEY, YOU KNOW, SPEAK TO  WHETHER TRADING RELATIONSHIP  IS NO FAIR OR NOT. BUT IT DOES  POINT THE IDEA THAT AT LEAST  AS OF RIGHT NOW, TRADE IN  MOTOR VEHICLE AND PARTS WITH  THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA  IS FAIRLY BALANCED. NOT SO  WITH MEXICO. THE AMERICANS HAD  THE DEFICITS AND ALSO SOME  PARTS LIGHT VEHICLES AND PARTS  OF 116 BILLION LOTS  ABSOLUTELY. SO I THINK, YOU  KNOW, IF WE WERE TO THINK OF,  YOU KNOW, WHAT COUNTRY IN THE  USMCA AREA HAS REALLY SEEN  PRODUCTION CHANGE THE MOST,  YOU KNOW, SINCE EVEN THE  SIGNING OF NAFTA, IT'S REALLY  THAT MEXICO SEEN ITS  PRODUCTION SHARE STEP UP  MEANINGFULLY. YOU KNOW,  CANADA, IF WE GO BACK TO THE  TURN OF 21ST CENTURY, WE WERE  PRODUCING AS MANY AS 3 MILLION  VEHICLES COMPARED TO THE ABOUT  1.4 MILLION NOW. AND SO WE  LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO THE  UNITED STATES AND THAT  PRODUCTION RELATIONSHIP WITH  YOU, HOW MUCH WE'RE PRODUCING,  HOW MUCH WE'RE BUYING  DOMESTICALLY.  >> AND IT'S JUST THAT, YOU  KNOW, SOME ASPECTS OF THAT  PRODUCTION CHAIN HAS SHIFTED  TO MEXICO, WHERE IT MAKES  SENSE IN PARTS OF THE SUPPLY  CHAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE  LABOUR INTENSIVE. BUT THE  CHALLENGE HERE, IT'S VERY  SPECIALIZED. NO, WE DON'T  REALLY COMPETE WITH THE U.S.  SO MUCH AS EACH OF US KIND OF  KNOW NARROW IN ON THE AREAS  THAT WE'RE THE BEST AT. AND BY  DOING SO, WE'RE ABLE TO  PRODUCE VEHICLES FOR CONSUMERS  IN NORTH AMERICA THAT HIGHER  QUALITY AND LOWER COSTS. AND  SO THAT IS THE CHALLENGE OF  UNWINDING THAT IT MEANS, YOU  KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO BE GIVING  UP SOME OF THOSE EFFICIENCIES  AND THAT PRODUCTIVITY IN ORDER  TO, YOU TO SOME DEGREE TRYING  TO YOU KNOW, MORE DOMESTIC  MANUFACTURING OF THESE THINGS,  THE UNITED STATES. BUT YOU  KNOW, THAT PART REMAINS  UNCLEAR. STILL, IT SOUNDS LIKE  IT OR INDUSTRIAL POLICY WHEN  IT COMES TO CARS HAS BEEN A  FAILURE THE CENTURY. I MEAN,  WE WERE A 3 MILLION VEHICLES  IN 1999. OUR ONLY ABOUT 1.3  MILLION. I KNOW 2 CLIENTS ARE  CLOSED FOR RETOOLING.  >> BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE OUR  INDUSTRY JUST BEEN HOLLOWED  OUT.  >> TO I THINK WE ALSO ARE A  LITTLE BIT OF A BENEFICIARY OF  FOR, YOU I GUESS THE LACK OF A  BENEFICIARY OR, YOU KNOW, A  LITTLE BIT OF FAILURE  CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE AROUND THE  KIND OF LAST BIG CYCLE, LENO,  2008, 2009 CRISIS. YOU, THE  DEMAND FOR VEHICLES REALLY  SHIFTED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY IN  NORTH AMERICA. WE STEP A  PRETTY EVEN BALANCE BETWEEN  PASSENGER CARS AND LIGHT  TRUCKS OR SUVS. AND WHAT WE'VE  ACTUALLY SEEN OVER THE LAST 15  YEARS OR SO, IS THAT  DRAMATICALLY TILTING THE  FAVOUR OF LIGHT TRUCKS, A 75%  TO 80% OF ALL VEHICLES WE SELL  IN NORTH AMERICA OR LIGHT  TRUCKS. IT JUST SO HAPPENED.  WE DIDN'T PRODUCE AS MANY OF  THOSE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 10 15  YEARS AGO. AND SO THAT'S ONE  OF THE REASONS WHY WE ACTUALLY  HAVE SEEN PRODUCTION, YOU  KNOW, TURN THE OTHER WAY IN  CANADA AS WELL AS SOME OF  THESE RETOOLING EFFORTS. AS  YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE  AUTOMAKERS FIGURE OUT WHAT THE  NEXT GENERATION OF AUTO  PRODUCTION LOOK LIKE.  >> AND OF COURSE, ESTABLISHING  AN INDIGENOUS AUTO INDUSTRY,  THAT'S A TALL ORDER. A LOT OF  COUNTRIES FAIL TO MAINTAIN  YABSLEY. I THINK WHAT YOU WANT  TO THINK IS BECAUSE WE REALLY  HAVE ONE BIG GIANT AUTO SECTOR  IN NORTH AMERICA TO TRY TO RE  SCALING HENRY SIZE THAT JUST  TO SERVE THE DOMESTIC MARKET  IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE  DOWN.

ON ELECTION DAY, VOTERS SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THEY WERE ENRAGED BY A SENSE THAT THINGS ARE NOT FAIR. FROM GROCERIES, TO RENTS, TO INSURANCE, THE STRESS OF THE\nCOST OF LIVING AND FEELINGS COST OF LIVING AND FEELINGS THAT OTHERS ARE GETTING AHEAD. AND THEY ARE LISTENING TO MEDIA STORIES ABOUT MIGRANTS GETTING HOTEL ROOMS AND DEBIT CARDS, BUT THEIR SON IS STILL LIVING AT HOME. FEELING THAT LACK OF FAIRNESS DROVE SO MANY VOTERS TO TRUMP BUT NOW THOSE VOTERS AND THE REST OF US ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHAT TRUMP'S POLICIES WOULD ACTUALLY DO. HERE TO DISCUSS, TWO OF MY ALL- TIME FAVES, DAN NATHAN IS HERE, COFOUNDER OF RISK REVERSAL, CNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST OF THE ON THE TAKE PODCAST, DAVID GIROUX FROM BLOOMBERG AND HOST OF THE BIG TAKE PODCAST. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ISSUE OF FAIRNESS? RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT LIKE THE ECONOMY IS WORKING FOR OTHERS AND NOT FOR THEM AND THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO FIX THAT. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?\n>> I THINK THE CAREFUL WHAT YOU >> I THINK THE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR SO IF WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE TERRORIST THAT TRUMP WANTS TO PUT IN PLACE, I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT A LOT OF VOTERS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT, FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAD, VERY BAD SURROGATES IN THE ECONOMY. >> YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS. >> AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE HAD UNEMPLOYMENT THAT REALLY ,50 OR SO. WE HAD INFLATION COMING DOWN FROM 9% TO 2.5% OR SO IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. INTEREST RATES STARTED TO COME DOWN. THE ECONOMY WAS GETTING BETTER AND THEY'RE HANDING OFF A VERY GOOD ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, I GET THE FAIRNESS THING, OKAY? BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY A LOT OF THE POLICIES THEY'VE ARTICULATED, BIG TAX CUTS FOR CORPORATIONS, TARIFFS AND THE LIKE, IT'S REALLY INFLATIONARY. SO IF WE SEE INFLATION STARTING TO GO BACK UP THEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS GOING TO HAVE TO START RAISING INTEREST RATES AGAIN AND WE'LL BE IN THE EXACT SAME SITUATION WE WERE TWO YEARS AGO. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE ALL KNOW THAT PARIS PLAY REALLY WELL ON THE RALLY STAGE. MAKE THE OTHER GUYS TAKE NOW IT'S TIME FOR THIS THING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN. >> WHAT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IS THAT THE WHOLE SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC THEORY AND PROVEN HISTORY GOES OUT THE WINDOW AND THESE TARIFF POLICIES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO PUT IN PLACE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING EVERYONE SAYS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO. TODAY AND'S POINTS WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE HUGELY INFLATIONARY. THE ON THESE BIG NUMBERS, VERY\nFEW DETAILS ON HOW THEY ARE FEW DETAILS ON HOW THEY ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK AT AS DAN IS SAYING, WE HAVE AN ECONOMY NOW THAT'S HUMMING, DOING GREAT. RELATIVELY SPEAKING YES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT. THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY HERE TO REALLY SCUTTLE THAT. >> DO YOU THINK HE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO DO IT? DO YOU THINK DAY ONE HE'S GOING TO GO FULL BORE, TARIFFS ACROSS THE BOARD, APPOINT SUPER RIGHT- WINGERS, PETER NAVARRO, OR I TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE LAST SEGMENT, DO YOU THINK THERE'S THIS CHANCE THAT TRUMP SEES THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT HE CALLS UP A JAMIE DIAMOND, A LARRY FINK AND SAYS, BE WITH ME, MAN, BE MY TREASURY SECRETARY? >> I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK THAT'S OPTIMISTIC BUT IF YOU THINK WHO'S RIGHT AT HIS SIDE RIGHT NOW IT'S ELON MUSK. ELON MUSK HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THAT IF WE DO NOT PUT TRADE AREAS ON CHINESE ELECTRIC VEHICLES, THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.\nI THINK HE USED THE WORD I THINK HE USED THE WORD DEMOLISH THE AUTO INDUSTRY. I THINK ELON WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO HIM. HIS WORLDVIEW IS PROBABLY A BIT MORE NUANCED THAN THAT OF TRUMP'S OR ANYONE ELSE THAT TRUMP PUTS AROUND HIM SO I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY -- WHAT WAS HIS THING, PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT? THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO A BUNCH OF THIS STUFF BECAUSE AGAIN, IF HE THINKS HE HAS A MANDATE HE'S ONLY GOING TO PAY HIS OFF A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HE BROUGHT OVER TOWARD HIS CAMP OVER THE LAST OBVIOUSLY MONTH OR TWO. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE RACHEL MADDOW HAS A NEW PIECE OUT IN THE NEW YORKER ALL ABOUT HOW AUTHORITARIANS REALLY WORK AND THE WAY IT REALLY WORKS IS THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN POLITICS OR POLICY. THEY'RE INTERESTED IN ENRICHING THEMSELVES. CORRUPTION AND ENRICHING THEMSELVES. MANY PEOPLE HAVE LIKENED TRUMP'S CAREER, OR POLITICAL CAREER, OR ASPIRATIONS TO THAT OF AN AUTHORITARIAN. LET'S TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT\nHIS BUSINESS IS AND HOW WELL HE HIS BUSINESS IS AND HOW WELL HE COULD DO BECAUSE REMEMBER LAST TIME AROUND WE WERE SAYING, OH MY GOSH, THIS IS CRAZY. NOW THE WHEELS ARE TRULY GOING TO COME OFF BECAUSE NO RULES WERE EVER PUT IN PLACE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. >> RACHEL READ A GREAT PIECE WHICH DRAWS A LOT FROM HISTORY BUT YOUR QUESTION IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND IN 2017 THERE WAS THAT NEWS CONFERENCE. DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT WITH HIS LAWYER, TALKED ABOUT THE BARRIERS THEY PUT IN PLACE ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. I THINK THIS TIME THAT'S ALL OUT THE WINDOW. NOT EVEN GOING TO COME UP. THERE'S GOING TO BE NO PRETENSE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU LOOK AT HIS PORTFOLIO TODAY. HE'S GOT THESE STRANGE DIGITAL CRYPTO CURRENCY ASSETS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE, WITH\nTHE COMPANIES HE STARTING. THE COMPANIES HE STARTING. HE'S GOT THESE NFT PLATS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THEN THERE IS THE OLD-SCHOOL REAL ESTATE STUFF AND BLOOMBERG HAD A BIG PIECE ON THAT THIS WEEK. I THINK WHAT'S SO FASCINATING IS A LOT OF LEASES ARE UP. HE'S GOING TO BE RENEGOTIATING. WHAT HE HAS NOW, TALK ABOUT THE ART OF THE DEAL, IS JUST FEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE, I DON'T WANT TO KISS OFF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HIS WORTH, HIS NET WORTH AND ALL OF THAT. HE COMES NOW FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE WITH SO MUCH MORE LEVERAGE THAN HE HAD BEFORE AND I THINK IT'S QUITE CLEAR HE'S GOING TO EXPLOIT THAT GOING FORWARD. >> RETRIBUTION, HE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO THAT. HE'S GOING TO BE A DICTATOR FOR A DAY AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOR MONTHS. ELON MUSK, I HATE TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS BUT THE IDEA THAT HE'S GOING TO BE A SHADOW PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY START TO THINK ABOUT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT ELON'S STOCK JUST DID, TESLA, IT JUST CAME $300 BILLION IN MARKET CAP SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY. >> THAT $150 MILLION HE SPENT ON THE CAMPAIGN, PENNIES. >> IT'S JUST SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE WAY FORWARD HERE, HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE GOVERNED AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE HIM WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRESS HIS THUMB ON THE SCALES THE WAY HE\nDID PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, WITH DID PRIOR TO THE ELECTION, WITH MONEY, THE WAY HE USED TWITTER OR X, HIS OWN PLATFORM, TO KIND OF MOVE AROUND, MISINFORMATION, DISINFORMATION. I JUST THINK WHY WOULD YOU SUSPECT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS? >> ELON MUSK, LIKE DONALD TRUMP, LIKES THIS IDEA OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAVING INFLUENCE OVER THE FEDERAL RESERVE. LIKE THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. BUT HOW IS THAT GOING TO PLAY? BECAUSE WHEN THE BOND MARKETS IS BEST A, DOESN'T MATTER WHO IS PRESIDENT. >> IT WAS CLEAR AT THAT PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK -- >> J POWELL, NO.\n>> BEFORE ALL OF THIS, HE'S NOT >> BEFORE ALL OF THIS, HE'S NOT AN ACADEMIC ECONOMIST. HE DOESN'T HAVE A PHD. HE'S A LAWYER AND IS CLEAR AT THAT PRESS CONFERENCE, HE'S GOING TO FIGHT THIS, IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS HIM TO RESIGN OR TRIES TO GET RID OF HIM. HE'S GOING TO PREVENT ANY STEPS TAKEN TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THE SANCTITY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS SO IMPORTANT. IT HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY", "duration(in seconds)": 455.0, "region": "US"}}

"script": "[Music] good morning everyone welcome to another relaxing coding Vlog today I decided to cycle downtown because I haven't been here in a long while and I wanted to see what's up and even though we still have some snow in the streets I really feel good about cycling today I'm continuing my work on the book and while in the previous Vlog I made that little check boox to Mark a page as completed this time around I'll be working on the back end part to save this information in the database and complete this entire feature but you may be wondering why am I digging through my backpack to find a pencil well yesterday I broke this little thing ofama jig on my rice fish loose and now I have to use a pen to unzip my jacket I just can't be bothered to fix these things and I can't be bothered even more to go and buy a new jacket just for this so for those of you who don't know I've been working on a book about software engineering and it has 101 different software engineering concept that I feel like were the most important and most useful for me in my engineering career but a lot of articles are also free so I put a link in the description if you'd like to check it out but in this video I want to give you a behind thesc scenes look on how it works while working on a feature request from a user in today's world you could almost describe this project as under engineered my goal is to show you that even with the simplest of tools you can make something that works and that users like so in the previous video I described how the front end is just a little bit of CSS and vanilla JavaScript and on the back end this entire thing is just a few little expressjs Services that's it and a static landing page so when it comes to hosting you can see I'm using a railway and the reason is I really like the pricing model where they charge you for actually used CPU memory and dis rather than how much you provisioned and that makes it possible to run a lot of different microservices where each one uses a little bit of resource here and there so up until this point the book service itself was actually completely stateless because I didn't need to keep track of any user information but now that I'm working on tracking the progress users as they go through the pages the first task was to connect a database and because I was using mongodb in another project I just decided to yank the whole configuration code from there but then I ran into my first question when naming collections in mongod DB should you use camel case or snake case for some reason snake case felt just a little bit off given that everything in my JavaScript codebase was cam case and after thinking about it for a while I decided to skip the whole conundrum and just rename my collection to use a single word but I'm curious what do you guys do after this I was making pretty solid progress and everything was going fine except that my scone has mysteriously vanished and as a bit of a spoiler this isn't the first mystery that unfolded today but at this point I was still unaware that it was going to happen so I just kept on going and continued implementing the progress end point both to update the progress of the user but also to get it later now there is no need to sugarcoat it the code you're looking at here has some massive glaring holes and numerous potential issues so I'm curious if you guys can see them but some time ago we had a discussion on my Discord server whether it's better to try and write your code perfect the first time around or if it's better to write any kind of version in the beginning and then improve it later and right now I was definitely trying the latter so I wasn't feeling insecure or anxious about the glaring security issues that I was introducing not nearly as anxious as I felt about what happened next when the second mysterious event started unfolding you see for no reason whatsoever my trackpad stopped working completely I mean I was able to move the mouse but I wasn't able to click and so I started panicking a little bit because I thought that the development version of one menu which I had running decided to somehow hijack my mouse and hold it for a ransom and straight up I just stopped one menu alt together but some of you with a Keen Eye might notice that I used activity monitor to try and see what's going on even though one menu has a pretty well functioning system monitoring feature but somehow in the moment it just didn't feel right to use one menu to stop itself it kind of felt a little bit morally wrong so I tried using activity monitor but it had such horrible keyboard support that I ended up using the terminal in the end but one menu wasn't at fault and the Mystery continued so I decided to try a different approach I remembered I had a mouse lying around in my bag so I thought maybe turning it on and off would fix the issue and here's a funny thing that I did you know one of these pads fell off and for a while I was thinking how can I replace it and then I just took the other one off cut it in half and if you will excuse the Pun It's not half as bad as it looks and I don't know what you think about that but I am kind of proud of my own makeshift solution there and speaking of solutions this actually did fix the problem which I don't know it's still a bit of a mystery never happened to me before but anyhow I continued coding up this feature and I won't say exactly but I spent anywhere between 5 and 35 minutes wondering why none of my code was actually working before I realized that maybe just maybe I should try logging in before testing my feature but it's just a detail right we're not going to take this as me being completely forgetful but anyhow after this things finally started working and I was quite pleased with the fact that I had at least something to show for my effort so I decided to call it a successful day and get going home in the next Vlog I'll be fixing the glaring issues that I left in the code so if you're interested to know what those are and what the fix is going to be make sure to like And subscribe so you can follow along and in the meantime if you're learning about software engineering check out the book again there's a lot of free articles in it and I will see you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 382.0, "region":

2.4% for the first quarter of 2025 so this would be the worst economic contraction since Q2 of 2020 that you know that was during the height of the pandemic so this drop it's due to reports of weaker consumer spending now I want to show you this video clip of trump and he and you're going to see it he's not ruling out the possibility of a recession in 2025 so please take a look let me stay on the economy for a moment because there are rising worries about a Slowdown you've got the Atlanta Federal Reserve saying we're going to have a contraction in the first quarter look I know that you inherited a mess and you said that the other here are you expecting a recession this year um I hate to predict things like that there is is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big we're bringing wealth back to America that's a big thing and there are always periods of it takes a little time it takes a little time but I don't I think it should be great for us I mean I think it should be great okay so you just saw that from president Trump he's not even ruling out the possibility of a recession in 2025 but there are other people such as I want to show you this video clip of Commerce Secretary lutnick saying that there's no chance of a recession so please take a look major Banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs now say a recession in the next 12 months is becoming more likely should Americans brace for a recession absolutely not anybody who bets against Donald Trump it's like the same people who thought Donald Trump wasn't going to winner a year ago Donald Trump is a winner he's going to win for the American people that's just the way it's going to be there's going to be no recession in America what there's going to be is global tariffs are going to come down because president Trump has said you want to charge us 100% we're going to charge you 100% And you know what they say they say no no no no no don't charge us 100% we'll bring ours down will unleash America out to the world grow our economy in a way we've never grown before you are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America As Americans you saw it 1.3 trillion of new investment coming in America that think of all those jobs and remember each trillion of investment in America is 1% of growth GDP so Donald Trump is bringing growth to America I would never bet on recession no chance now let's take a look at the stock markets so here's a one-year charts of the S&P 500 here is January 20th when President Trump came into office so you can compare that to where we are today so right before Trump came into office the market was stalling but recently it's been economic concerns you know that's really been dragging down the markets and I'm not going to beat around the bush a lot of these economic concerns are stemming from Trump's policies regarding tariffs now president Trump was recently asked about the stock market downturn and I want to show you his response so I want okay so I want to say this because the reporter it's hard to hear his question at the be very beginning they ask if he is concerned about the stock market market sell off so please take a look when you look at the market selling off that didn't concern you and where do you see it does concern me I think some some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they're buying and now I want to show you the price of Bitcoin so this is a one-year chart so here is January 20th when President Trump came into office and you can compare that to where we are today so I'm only bring up Bitcoin because president Trump wants to turn the us into the crypto capital of the world so let's I want to tell you this the reason why I don't want to give my opinion is because and this is just my perspective again this is just me it's too early I want more time I want to see how things play out and then I'll give you my opinion but of course it's going to be based on the facts and the results because of course president Trump made some big promises and let's see if he delivers that's all for today please subscribe thank you for the support and wish a very nice day take care", "duration(in seconds)": 506.0, "region": "US"}}

investors assess the impacts of the tariff escalations with China But let's talk about pockets of investing opportunities on the Chinese side We got Crane Shares chief investment officer Brendan Ahern uh joining us now Brendan um as we watch Kb your ETF very closely Um it's actually up a little bit still on the year Um we've seen some standouts the likes of Alibaba for example But what happens now now that these huge 145% tariffs have been imposed yeah I think the there's a little bit of a unfortunately we're stuck in this tit fortat retaliation I think ultimately the Chinese government is taking the view that less than 3% of their GDP is represented by US uh trade with the United States versus 70 to 80% of the US economy is dependent on consumption So so I think China's going to be much more focused on raising domestic consumption There's a lot of talk about coming domestic consumption stimulus that might actually come overnight There's some rumors there So I think China is uh basically saying you know we're just going to focus on what we can control and if the US wants to cut off access to our products that affects the US then maybe it affects China Brennan um correct me if I'm wrong um because I often am Brennan but I feel like last time we spoke were you in the camp that believe listen at the end of the day there is going to be a grand bargain made here between Trump and Xi Um am I right about that Brandon was that your position if it is is that still your position and and what do you think the outlines of such a bargain could actually look like yeah I mean definitely we thought you know President Trump is a successful business person that this was the art of the deal Uh that he's expressed that he has a personal relationship with President Xi Close advisors like Elon Musk are heavily exposed to China's economy and know China well So we thought you know there's a real recipe for a mutually beneficial deal to take place Uh I think other advisers in the Trump administration recommend taking a very hard stance out of the gate with these exceedingly high uh tariff levels which you know really again I I think I think it's probably surprised the China side but now that they know what hand uh has been played by the administration I think they'll make a pivot toward domestic consumption knowing that these tariffs really hurt the US consumer potentially far more than it hurts the Chinese economy and you know hope you know mo you know maybe this tactic from adver you know really I think promoted by certain advisers within the administration backfires on the US obviously you've seen the reaction in the US equity market it's it's a very costly economics 101 lesson with trillions of dollars of US wealth lost in instigating a trade war when they could have gone about it in such a different fashion and so are there Chinese companies that you think are sort better positioned while all this is going on Well I mean it's self- serving and highly biased but you know I love the companies we hold within within K web because they're geared to the US Chinese domestic consumption story They basically have no revenue to the United States I would caution that you know there's rumors that does the administration try to put pressure on China by talking about ADR dellisting Um for that reason you know we've really converted uh the vast majority of our K webb holdings to the Hong Kong share class where you know it's something that that we did a while ago Uh but I think investors it's something that we're hearing talk about you know do they go after but again you know again this we've seen trillions of dollars of US wealth hurt by this tariff policy The US ADRs are held by US investors If you delist them you do not hurt China you hurt US investors It just it's really hard to explain some of the things that we're seeing out there What what are the what are the actual probabilities you give that Brena delisting i I I mean hopefully it's low Um you know the the idea of delisting was because Chinese law prevented the public company Accounting Oversight Board from doing audit reviews The Chinese changed their law The PBOC and SEC have publicly stated the companies are complying So I I think this is where if if I was if I was an Elon Musk uh I'd be very worried because this feels like a direct attack uh really trying to you know I don't I don't know what the thought process is of the ADRD listing again you're only going to hurt US investors let let's be very clear uh so it seems a nons nonsensical approach but again it's why why we're we've moved out of the US lines where we can here's what Brennon just to get your response here what Kyle Bass said about X here's what he posted I would love to get your response he said we should have delisted Chinese stocks when the Communist Party of China refused to allow Western audits Can you imagine how much fraud is hiding under those Chinese reported numbers what do you say to that um please visit sec.govhfca GVHFCA because you will read the SEC on their actual website say that the companies adhere to US regulatory standards after the PBOC went to China and met with their auditors who by the way are companies called PWC Ernstston Young Deote and Touch KPMG I mean talk about someone you should not listen that clearly has no idea what they're talking about Let me ask you this Bren There was an interesting piece in Baron today I I want to get your take on this And they were sort of gaming out what X's next moves could be Um and they were listing things like he might finding ways to support his exporters allowing his currency to weaken maybe going after big American companies What do you think how would you rank probabilities there what do you think his next moves are i mean what are they going to devalue their currency by 150% I mean it's it's that hurts that in that hurts Chinese households So so this devaluation concern I think is um is you know I think I think China's going to say we know what the US policy is We're going to focus on domestic consumption which we can control and I I think I think we you know we're on the precipice of significant Chinese stimulus uh because the you know the perception is that you know 1.4 billion Chinese people are making iPhones only sold in the United States That's just not true you need to kind of do the math and you know just look at chat GP ask chat GPT you know how much of China's GDP is dependent upon US trade it's less than 3% less than three so if you can raise domestic consumption you can more than offset that weakness and again I think this really really hurts the US consumer I think you're really going to see already a contraction in US consumer confidence um it's really going to play on the consumer here which represents a disproportionate percentage of the GDP It's it's it's kind of scary if you start to really think about it I really hope cooler heads prevail You I could ask ch chat GBT but I would always rather prefer to have you Brennan on the show Thank you so much for feelings mutual Feelings mutual Appreciate it Thank you sir", "duration(in

[Applause] him in a competitive setting the effectiveness of Aikido would face a tough test against the direct and aggressive approach of MMA the outcome hinges on the Fighter's experience technical Mastery and adaptability Under Pressure although Steven seagull has Decades of training his lack of competitive MMA experience May limit his ability to adapt in a physically intense fight on the other hand McGregor's extraordinary power gives him a significant Edge though Seal's psychological tactics could potentially exploit weaknesses in McGregor's aggression in the controlled environment of AD Dojo seagull's refined techniques might stand out however in the chaotic realm of an MMA fight McGregor's striking abilities would likely secure the upper hand the shot that dropped Redmond seconds left to go in the round and L's in to celebrate with us the notorious one as a 7th degree black belt in iido Steven seagull's fighting style is centered on redirecting an opponent's energy and using their momentum against them his techniques are refined efficient and can be devastating when applied correctly while iido is largely defensive its techniques are designed to neutralize an opponent swiftly regardless of their size or strength [Music] on the other hand Conor McGregor is renowned for his Precision striking unconventional movement and Relentless attacks McGregor has proven his

demeanor and magnetic charisma seagull has been a prominent Hollywood action icon since the 1980s but who is Steven seagull behind the scenes could he defeat a fighter like Conor McGregor in a real life Showdown Steven Frederick seal was born on April 10th 1952 in Lancing Michigan USA from a young age he displayed a strong interest in martial arts during his teenage years his family relocated to California where he began training in karate however his fascination with Japanese culture eventually led him to iido a martial art focused on harmonizing movements to neutralize [Music] attacks in the 1970s Steven seagull made a bold decision to move to Japan to deepen his understanding of iido he became one of the first foreigners to successfully open an iido do in the Land of the Rising Sun

try to show you some basic techniques that I've used for a long time in my life I periodically like to come and spend time with them and talk to them usually a little bit about moreover he has shared his iido expertise with prominent MMA fighters including Alex Pereira Anderson Silva and leoto Mach I go like this you what are you going to do so we're here boom look BL a fight between Steven seagull and Conor McGregor would be difficult to predict as both are exceptional fighters from vastly different martial arts disciplines MMA is rooted in adaptability combining techniques from various combat Styles while iido relies on the ability to control and redirect an opponent's attacks McGregor's Relentless forward pressure might overwhelm a traditional aido practitioner however seagull's exceptional sense of timing could create an opportunity for a powerful Counterattack in a real world confrontation or a street fight the rules of the octagon would no longer apply if McGregor closed the distance quickly his striking prowess and ground game could give him a decisive Advantage done once again with some vicious hand absolutely still put into use that on the other hand if seagull

the first successful power device underwent testing in 1903 by the American Brothers Orville and right they piloted their right flyer over 180 ft in 12 seconds without any mishaps like falling and dying extra points for that years later during the early stages of World War I planes were used for reconnaissance missions it wouldn't take long before Pilots started to bring Firearms to fight off other planes from handheld weapons and lap carried bombs it was only a matter of time before these weapon systems were installed on the airframe itself the era of the dog fights have begun a Dutch guy named Anthony fuer sorry for the name invented the synchronized machine gun that could shoot its bullets without destroying the plain's own propeller pretty useful as it turned out one of the most famous fighter aces of all time was Manfred Von Roven aka the Red Baron this handsome champ shot down 80 enemy planes eventually his own plane was hit by enemy fire and he crashed and then he died but still a KD of 80 to1 cool stats for a tombstone after World War I many new countries joined the arms race to build the ultimate propeller powered fighter play with the outbreak of World War II there were multiple very capable fixed wi fighter planes roaming high in the skies of Europe the German mesmi bf19 battled against the British hurricans and Spitfires during the Battle of Britain especially the supermarine Spitfire was a true match for the German Fighters but besides the superb flying characteristics of the Spitfires Britain also effectively implemented the world's first integrated air defense system using radar the Germans on the other hand had this guy lft fuffle eating G shouting out inconsistent and confusing commands like some frustrated and annoyed chubby man on a diet which he wasn't on a diet I mean so he was frustrated annoyed and chubby just not on a diet okay moving on on the Eastern Front the BF 109 and the [ __ ] of wolf 195 figh battled with shitloads of russian-built yak planes and the very funny looking i16 donkey planes which still posed a serious threat for potentially causing German Pilots to laugh themselves out of the sky on the Asian side of the planet the Japanese carrier based zero fighter showed off its dominance in the Asian theater of war and a bit in Pearl Harbor ouch sorry America however it wouldn't take long before the lightweight zero fighter was going to be outclass the US carrier based Wildcat and other Superior us aircrafts were hunting down zero Fighters like there was no tomorrow and for many Japanese Pilots there wasn't one during the battle of the Philippine Sea the slaughtering of so many zero fighter planes earned the nickname The Great Mariana's turkey shoot later it turned out the zero would be most effective just stuffed with explosives and one suicidal pilot with the appearance of the P38 Lightning and the p 51 Mustang the dominance of Allied air power in the Pacific and the European continent would be guaranteed despite having air superiority the Allied Pilots still had a reason to [ __ ] their pants far above the smoking ruins of what used to be Germany a super fast and strange sounding aircraft was strafing Allied bomber formations the me262 was the first operational jet fighter fighter bomber to side note the bomber thing Hitler's idea a bad one and one of many another super fast and weird sounding aircraft was the me163 comet an aircraft which was basically more of a rocket with a guy called the inverted commas pilot strapped to it the person [ __ ] his pants the most in this case was probably the pilot himself since it was more dangerous to be inside one of these things than outside however at the end of World War II it was the me262 that marked the beginning of the jet age from the Korean War throughout the Vietnam War the Cold War and various other Wars some of them a bit boring to the present day many countries continued to develop new jet fighters to maintain an edge in jet Innovation and Technology bling bling when the Korean War started in the ' 50s the Americans were busy flying b29 bomb emissions to barbecue the North Koreans with firebombs in response the USSR built MC5 was sent out against these bombing raids only to be counted by the us-built f86 saber NATO codenamed the mig5 as the [ __ ] the plane was easy to recognize by its distinctive large round hole in the front of the fuselage which clearly has nothing to do with its code name [Music] [ __ ] oh the name is [ __ ] so that's [ __ ] and not [ __ ] sorry for that as the Cold War heated up jet fighters became big players during the Vietnam war with the US showcasing the F4 Phantom 2 a plane so versatile it could probably make a cappuccino mid-flight the North Vietnamese kind of ruined this coffee break by placing surface to a missiles all over the place and the Soviets retaliated with the mig21 a plane so iconic that it became the go-to reference for every Cold War movie ever made when the mid 25 fox bat was introduced in 1970 the Americans were yet again [ __ ] their PS flying close to Mac 3 the Americans believed they were witnessing the most advanced jet fighter to date until some Russian dude decides to Desert and fly a gift WRA Mig 25 to Japan basically into the hands of the Americans turns out the Mig 25 was an Interceptor and not a multi-roll fighter aircraft and extra bad news for the Russians the multi-roll fighter was apparently the way forward just not Mac 3 kind for with the compliments of Tom Cruz in his shining F-14 Tomcat this brings us to one of the best fighter aircraft ever produced the F-15 Eagle has been in service longer than your mom and still looks very attractive it even finished off more pilots than your mom by shooting down 104 enemy planes despite many of them ejecting prematurely joking aside shooting down that many enemy planes is obviously an impressive air-to-air kill death ratio to be exact 104 to to zero yep that's right not a single F-15 loss for comparison the worst Mig 23 variant holds a KD ratio of 1 to four which is not so great the F-15 was followed by the F-16 Fighting Falcon in 1987 one of the most versatile and maneuverable fighters ever produced The Fighter is also exported to numerous NATO countries and other Air Forces combined with its great adaptability for new technology this explains why so many f16s are still in s today the Russian answer was Swift with the mid 29 fulcrum and the su27 flanker both planes were designed with a focus on agility and speed for airto a combat these multi-roll Fighters are also in service in various Air Forces around the world at this point the introduction of stealth technology quietly made its way into the new f-17 NW um where the [ __ ] is it oh stealth right though not formerly designated as a fighter the f17 Nighthawk pioneered the use of stealth technology laying the foundation for its influence on the emerging fifth generation jet fighters you can compare these fighters to your new iPhone but then nonsteroids and without the sweat shops and being able to fly Beyond Mac 2 and have a lot of apps on it like jet flick instabang face cook Ali by-bye spottify and air TNT fun Tech to drive all of these apps can be found in the F-22 Raptor and the F35 lightning 2 making them two of the most advanced stealth fighters to fly in the skies today Russia introduced the Su 57 stealth multiroll fighter in 20120 many European countries currently operate the Euro Fighter typhoon except for the French they fly the daso Rafal an aircraft with an internal fuel tank containing 4,500 L of red wine it carries a payload of four giant bagett or it carries an 80t long white Banner we're sorry France we did it again because well we just can't resist

Ferrari is a lazy idiot whenever I charter a jet for a flight I always ask the Steuart S do you take weekends do you stop working at five great stop complaining that you aren't making i recently talked to a Wall Street Journal reporter about how young men are investing in things like stocks crypto and more recently politics and because of that I was able to make it into the article i mean that's me but shout out to Financial Failure he was the main focus on this article and he was the one that even hooked me up on getting the interview his channel covers more cryptoreated topics and it'll be linked down in the description but this overall experience actually raises really important questions like why are young men today more tempted or I would consider more desperate than previous generations to make financial bets let's start with the obvious in 2025 the conversation about making money has never seemed more urgent unlike previous generations new form of investors aren't playing it safe they're not primarily value investors they're only focused on maximizing returns and this is simply because everyone feels like they need to because they're living in a harsh economy see 70% of Gen Z and millennials are living paycheck to paycheck student loan debt has reached a total of $1.7 trillion while home prices have nearly doubled in the past two decades but real wages haven't grown i mean they're nearly stagnant so now more than ever people truly have that get rich or die trying they're trying to take bigger swings and the main focus because of this is that they're currently living in hardship and they want to escape it the real conversation needs to be had of what truly is the working class it's simply paycheck to paycheck only working just to survive and most people don't want to live in that situation because many people are trying to break out of that slow and steady income because they're not getting the results that they were promised trying to risk it all is probably the only way that people see results that previous generations were nearly guaranteed to get i mean just think back a few generations ago sitcoms were really average of just a single parent income household while living in middle suburbia so asking why people are willing to take such a large bet well it's simply a reaction to the current living conditions they're in let's be real wall Street Bets was simply a reaction to Wall Street excluding average people who wanted to invest their money and crypto is simply a financial response to the '08 crisis which locked out many Americans and only helped out the traditional wealthy and betting on sports politics or current events is simply just that desire to turn frustration into potential profits all these movements and reactions are simply a response to someone being systematically ignored and while obviously these come with risk I feel like people aren't looking out for the main thing that they actually come with which is hope in a community a recent example was literally Wall Street Bets users rallying with GameStop i mean most people hated GameStop but this wasn't just to make money it was actually to stick it to the hedge funds who were taking advantage of people for so long because it's very clear and googable that the top hedge fund CEOs are able to buy homes that are up to $200 million that's a clear form of rebellion against the system that has been depriving average people for so long now obviously this intent can come with a form of greed but it comes out of survival and even while stating most of this information I feel like people are missing the elephant in the room which people are broke and the reason why articles like this sort of focus on it is that because young men are feeling this the hardest so they're willing to risk more i mean you could find so many studies that talk about how young men aged under 30 have the highest rate of unemployment or underemployment amongst all age groups and a scary stat is that an average 25-year-old working today is making less than his father did at the same age if you adjust for everything like inflation but it's not just wages it's the overall cost of living for instance the medium rent for most places in a high cost of living area is well over $2,000 to $3,000 for most places and that just comes with like a studio apartment the average home price for a starter home is well over $400,000 and don't even get me started on the price of gas because the transportation cost must be factored in if you want to go anywhere a gallon of gas used to cost anywhere from $2 to $3 but now can stretch as far as 56 $7 meanwhile everyone's simply telling everyone to work harder but if you understand the concept of pull yourself up by your bootstrap it's just a sort of disingenuous term because if you ever tried it you're pulling yourself up which is even harder forced to do because today people are literally watching pensions disappear union efforts get crushed i mean even college degrees are sort of losing value everyone has them so what's left for most people risk and this comes with the form of illusion through most platforms see first in this case we need to talk about investing which is the first gateway drug directly after co we saw retail investors trade up to $600 billion through ETFs and this was primarily on accounts like Robin Hood well nothing is inherently wrong with the platform it's slowly enabling a new form of investing which is yolo investing which if you're familiar with Wall Street Bets subreddit then you know what I'm talking about and if you literally go back to the heights of GameStop you saw Robin Hood have 3 million new users in one month on one hand you were able to see people invest in options and turn $100 into $5,000 so the appeal for something like this is completely obvious it's easy to use it has an instant order execution and there's zero commissions and on top of this it was likely number one in the app store so people didn't have to go anywhere but the less had conversation but was just as common as how people were losing money it's like everyone overnight became a day trader but if you know any stats most day traders lose money and unfortunately with the meme stock rallies retail investors were the last one holding when the stock went to zero but still that dream of getting money fast is what keeps people around and just as fast as people will go to investing people will turn to crypto see for many crypto isn't just an asset it's more of a lifestyle and while yes there are plenty of projects that have great devs that have technical understanding that are hoping on the project I would say most users in the space are only in it for the money see while on one hand you have things like Bitcoin and Ethereum you have meme coins on the opposite while you could always argue that one of these random coins has a potential it just comes with a gambling frenzy the crypto market at its peak neared $3 trillion dogecoin surged 15,000% in one year but the problem with this is that most crypto traders lost money most retail investors were the one left holding the bag with the rug pulls and the pump and dumps apps like Coinbase and Binance made it very easy to invest and spaces like Twitter and Reddit made it very cool to have a community but now a new memecoin literally launches by the hour with Tik Tok users pushing tokens that literally vanish overnight because for many crypto is literally just a digital scratchoff ticket and this is what leads me into what I think is probably the worst form of investing which is gambling this is literally the gamified version of well everything you can bet on sports politics and anything in between sports books DraftKings FanDuels all of these have become household names all of these have simply turned your phone into a casino or worse you can go to like Stake or Kick and see 24/7 betting on sports slots dice and I mean everything in between life events and you can bet on things like the presidential election federal decisions celebrity outcomes sport outcomes and you can do all of this from your Robin Hood app and let's call it like it is the reason why it exists and the reason why it's growing is because it makes a lot of money just the sports betting market alone hit 11 billion in revenue in 2023 and it's likely only going to increase but the gambling addiction amongst men under 30 has increased nearly 60% in the last 5 years and if you go to most content creators you can follow a rabbit hole of XQC's Aiden Ross all gambling and while I don't want to simply put the blame of gambling on content creators it's at least brought it to the mainstream gambling used to be limited to certain sections certain states but it seems like it's going to be mainstream relatively soon because of how much money it makes that's why it's no longer just casino gambling now it's sports gambling next it's going to be live events gambling all of this invokes emotion you're going to be tied to betting on your team your identity your beliefs you're just scratching that itch because it's very clear we have the data gambling addiction is very bad but with the stats we also have on increasing population doing it it's only going to get worse and with all of that it only makes it harder to stop but I completely understand why people are doing it remember this is simply a response to the question why the overall solution is simply financial freedom but it's going to come in the form of messy decisions and whether it be stocks crypto or gambling this gives you a tribe and hope but the way out is going to be messy no matter the situation because you're up against a multi-trillion dollar machine people are up against multiple systems that are designed to take their time their attention their money literally leaving them with nothing this system thrives on you having hope to get out because at the end of it you're only going to be addicted confused and broke but at the end of this you have to understand the real play out of this it's going to be get educated and understand that you're even up against that multiple trillion dollar machine you have to focus on building real skills you have to understand delayed gratification because you understand instant gratification gets you nowhere that slow and steady progress only works if you have a tangible skill that helps you get out because the truth is that this get-richquick scheme is built on your loss we have to have an open conversation of trying not to be the product and hopefully be the exception now I'm going to have a link to the article down in the description but

Indices across the US, UK, Europe, Japan and India have plunged. Trump says the US economy is “sick” and tariffs are the cure, but global agencies warn of deepening recession risks. The International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization and major banks like JPMorgan have all raised alarm. As retaliatory tariffs emerge and uncertainty grows, markets are in turmoil. Investors are bracing for long-term fallout. The trade war Trump initiated may have no winners—only losses, and mounting global economic pain.\n\n---\n\nUSA | Donald Trump | Trade Policy | US Politics | Liberation Day | Trade War | International Trade | Trump Tariffs | Trump | Trump Tariff Announcement | Tariff Announcement | Trump Tariff Speech | Trump | US Economy | Donald Trump | Trump | Trump Tariff Speech | Trump Tariffs | President Donald Trump | Tariffs | Tariff Announcement |  Trump Tariff | Donald Trump Tariff | US Market | Stock Market | Recession | NASDAQ | Nifty | Sensex | Dow Jones | Firstpost | World News | News Live | Vantage | Palki Sharma | News\n\n#donaldtrump #trumptariffs #tariffs #stockmarket #recession #dowjones #stocks #trumplive #liberationday #live #news #uspolitics #usa #donaldtrump #trumptariffs  #trumptariff #donaldtrump #firstpost #vantageonfirstpost #palkisharma #worldnews\n\nVantage is a ground-breaking news, opinions, and current affairs show from Firstpost.

going to be so proud of your country You're going to be so proud of your president We're going to turn it around and we're going to start winning again We're going to win so much We're going to win at every level We're going to win so much You may even get tired of winning And you'll say \"Please please It's too much winning We can't take it anymore Mr president it's too much And I'll say \"No it isn't We have to keep winning We have to win more We're going to win more We're going to win so much.\" Donald Trump loves winning You just heard him say that His tariff plan was built on that promise Trump wants to win global trade by waging a trade war But today there are no winners Trump's trade war is making everyone lose and the stock market is the biggest loser of all The selloff has been brutal Just look at the numbers America's Dow Jones the S&P 500 the NASDAQ UK's Footsie 100 Germany's DAX Japan's Nikai and India's Nifty Every major index is in the red It is a stock market armageddon and it was induced by the Trump tariffs Now look at the losses in one day American investors alone have lost some $2.4 trillion in one day $2.4 trillion This is the biggest one-day wipeout since 20120 And that was the year the pandemic struck So basically for the markets the tariffs are proving to be as deadly as the Wuhan virus And India has not been spared Investors here lost some 9.5 lakh crore rupees today That's over $110 billion All thanks to a trade war that no one asked for Trump says he's not surprised by any of this He was expecting the markets to crash First we'd love to get your reaction sir to what's going on in the financial markets today Well I mean it's to be expected where uh this is a patient that was very sick who was a sick patient and went through an operation on liberation day and it's going to be uh it's going to be a booming country a very booming country It's going to be amazing Actually Trump says the US economy is sick and tariffs are the cure But as things stand the cure is hurting more than the disease He's right on one point though The sell-off is not surprising at all Investors are jumping ship They're dumping stocks because their investments no longer reflect the new reality We are in a global trade war and like all wars it is chaotic Donald Trump has not set any deadlines He looks prepared to drag this out What we have is we have a set of tariffs based on uh what they've been charging that's reciprocal and those uh tariffs have come in and many every country's called us That's the beauty of what we do Uh we put ourselves in the driver's seat Some trade US trade partners are already hitting back They have imposed retaliatory tariffs on the US Others are mulling their options We'll tell you more about this in just a bit For the moment let's look at the US president He has targeted 60 countries and trading blocks Not everyone will be able to strike a deal with him and get out of this So if you're an investor this is a tricky time to make bets Be very careful No one knows how this trade war will shape up There is significant risk both in the short and the long term Global agencies are sounding an alarm Like the International Monetary Fund or the IMF its head Cristina Georgie Evva has issued a warning She says Trump's tariffs threaten the global economy Georgie Eva has appealed to the US that the IMF does not want a protracted war They want America to end these trade tensions and reduce the uncertainty And remember the US is the IMF's largest shareholder So this statement is quite significant It is a rare criticism of the United States But the IMF's concerns are valid A global recession cannot be ruled out this year Look at what JP Morgan is saying It is the biggest American bank It has raised the odds of a global recession to 60% 60 Earlier that figure was 40% So Trump's tariff announcement has caused a 20% bump The World Trade Organization or WTO is alarmed too It has projected a 1% fall in global trade Now this is a contraction of 1% And the WTSTO says that it is deeply concerned because tariffs would lead to a chain reaction Although Washington is downplaying it the US Vice President JD Vance says this is and I'm quoting \"This is just one bad day for the markets.\" Although he did warn about long-term pain you don't fix that stuff overnight We know people are struggling We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us but it's not going to happen immediately So how would this play out tariffs will make imported goods expensive This will reduce the demand for goods which in turn will impact factories the ones that make these goods The factories will be forced to cut supplies This will disrupt supply chains and the job market The high entry barriers will force companies to rethink their strategy They will have to consider the cost of tariffs They will have to relocate to avoid them And none of this will happen overnight But if the tariffs stay it will happen Hence the long-term pain This is Donald Trump's gift to the world Greeting you with aloha and namaste No I I I love India Presence uh occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India What we saw in Kashmir how do you see Trump's America yes the current administration behaves differently from the previous administration Are you saying that there are foreign powers who are trying to bring down the current government in Syria exactly Iran maybe Russia actually Prime Minister Modi committed to South you know corporations for not over 50% Is Ukraine prepared to pay the price for that peace no compromises at the cost of territorial integrity and sovereignity Thank you very much for having me I'll clear up", "duration(in seconds)": 466.0, "region": "US"}}

coming in we are learning uh India has sealed the Rafal fighter deal it's the second mega deal for India and uh this is for 26 Rafal marine aircrafts that has been signed we understand the deal is worth 63,000 cr rupees and more information now coming in french defense minister is expected to visit India and that is when the deal is to be signed this month my colleague Shivar is also now joining us on the broadcast here getting us more on that well uh Shiv we understand uh that this is the second mega deal that's going to be signed by the end of the month what more details do we have uh Kitty this uh deal for 26 Rafal aircraft is for the Indian Navy remember it's India's second uh deal for the French Rafal fighters the first deal was signed in 2016 that was for 36 Rafal for the Indian Air Force those fighters have already been delivered uh so this is the second uh the aircraft is the same it's still the Rafal except that these fighters unlike the air force versions will be operating off an aircraft carrier deck uh that the INS Vikrant and the INS Vikramitya are the Indian Navy's two aircraft carriers right now which have been hungry for new generation fighters for many years now the Indian Navy currently operates uh you know the Soviet era MiG 29K fighters off its aircraft carrier decks uh and the Indian Navy's air arm has been uh you know wanting next generation fighters for a very very long time so this is a huge piece of good news for the Indian Navy and also very good news in terms of general Indian air power in the Indian Ocean region because uh these Rafal fighters while very similar to the ones already operated by the Indian Air Force uh you know come with uh uh you know many new capabilities they will have anti-hship missiles which of course the Indian air force also has that capability but specifically in terms of deterrence fleet defense in the Indian Ocean at a time when the Chinese are being uh increasingly aggressive as far as trying to uh create a mark and create influence in the Indian Ocean every bit of power and power projection actually matters and these Rafal fighters that the Indian Navy will you know will begin to uh uh receive delivery of maybe in the next couple of years will add to that air power allow the Indian Navy to reestablish its primacy in the Indian Ocean very very capable aircraft this definitely comes as a big boost to the Indian Rafal fleet that means uh our Rafal fleet is now going to increase to 62 when when these uh Rafal jets are delivered ship that is correct uh you you know the the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force have for a long time you know suffered from uh uh the fact that they operate many disparate types of aircraft uh you know which brings in a nightmare of inventory and cost and I think this is one of the few times when the you know the Indian military have decided to acquire a similar kind of aircraft the air force going for the Rafal the Indian Navy also acquiring the Rafal uh you know similar or same aircraft bring with it lots of economies in terms of spare parts in in terms of maintenance repair overhaul uh sustenance ownership and that kind of thing quite apart from the fact kitty that there's going to be a huge amount of synergy obviously between the Indian Navy and the air force the air force started receiving their Rafals uh during the pandemic uh and they've uh these aircraft have already been operationalized they've been deployed in Ladak some of them are deployed in the eastern sector two squadrons with the air force so over the last few years the air force has gotten very very valuable combat or uh you know preparedness experience with the Rafal so with the Indian Navy now set to receive these aircraft it's going to add to their combat potential there'll be a lot of learnings from the air force how they've been able to learn about how to use these aircraft in Indian conditions and let me tell you Indian combat conditions are vastly different from anywhere else uh definitely in France you know we're in the tropics we've got uh the Himalayas to take care of we've got the eastern sector to take care of we've got the entire Indian Ocean to defend as well and that's where these fighters are really going to plug in so I can tell you it's going to be a very happy day for the Indian Navy yes absolutely so the deal includes 22 singleseater aircrafts and we understand four twin seater aircrafts which have been designed specifically for Indian Navy's operational requirements all right Shiv we understand so these Rafal jets uh uh that are uh specifically now designed for India's Navy's uh operational requirements are going to be tailored for operations from our aircraft carrier INS Vikrant that is correct uh uh you know there are when the in when India signed the original deal for Rafals for the Indian Air Force uh a major component of that deal kitty was what was called India specific enhancements uh now these India specific enhancements were basically modifications to the original Rafal fighter to uh you know to make them much more compatible with Indian conditions uh Indian combat profiles Indian threat perceptions uh what are called Indian threat libraries in terms of what India faces from China Pakistan the Indian Ocean etc these are of course of a very classified nature but they have to do with software with different kinds of weapons certain cockpit and electronic equipment as well uh that is not to be revealed uh those India specific enhancements will most certainly be part of the Indian Navy Rafal as well so what we will be getting is informally called a Rafal I or a Rafal India uh because uh while it is the baseline aircraft that the French use and a few other customers have acquired as well uh it is customized and tailor made for the very very unique requirements that the Indian military has absolutely thank you so much for getting us all those details there well of course a big day for India and India is all set to acquire 26 Rafal jets this is the second mega deal which is expected to be signed very soon between India and France india will be uh acquiring these 26 Rafal marine fighter aircraft from France as the center now has cleared a government to government deal as per the information coming in we are are also learning now the deal is valued at over 63,000 cr rupees and is expected to be signed in the coming few weeks", "duration(in seconds)": 369.0, "region": "US"}}

simple console programs making my own engines and even working on sea of Thieves this is 2 years of C++ I started my journey all the way here at the bottom of the food chain I knew zero C++ never touched it and never planned to the plans changed because I applied to University and turns out I now have to learn it make a game make another game and thenn low-level programming wait let's slow down a little I started by attending lectures that taught me C++ let's just say this was really boring and I was not getting anywhere with it so I decided to go home and practice what was taught in those lectures it was really simple things at first like outputting text to the console or checking for input but I was actually doing it I was technically programming in C++ I did this for a few months but it got to a point where I wasn't going anywhere I already knew the ins and outs of writing texts or trying different algorithms thankfully in time came a new semester where I would now have to make a game with C++ now my small brain at the time didn't comprehend how this would work you see I thought you needed game engines to make games but turns out there is other Solutions like Frameworks and so I started using this thing called sdl which basically allows me to turn this console project into a window that now can check for input have Graphics audio and more at the end of the semester I had created a simple Pac-Man clone but I learned a new things like how to make a text level editor how to save high scores create different AIS path finding Etc at this point I was pretty confident with C++ but that was all about to come crashing down with the next year of University projects yeah you read that correctly I needed to now create my own graphical application for those who don't know what that is I have to first create a window that write 100 lines of code to Rend of a single Square scrap that we now need a cube which means another 300 lines of code Fu then we need to create our own Shader what even our shaders how do I make shaders I don't know then we needed to do ah so um I did in fact complete the engine eventually I made a video about it for those interested by the way but here are some screenshots and videos of it working but guess what my professors are clinically insane and now I have to do all of this again but this time instead of just Graphics I have to add physics to it okay so like again I did eventually do this and I guess let's make this video slightly educational here is a list of features I implemented most importantly I was happy with this thing here anyways this was actually a massive step forwards in me learning C++ since now I was no longer just using the bass console project instead I was using things like direct X openg goo Etc if you yourself want to be doing these kinds of things then today's sponsor brilliant is the answer now hang on give me just one minute of your time brilliant is essentially just a platform that you can access for your browser you go on it and learn but not just by sitting there and listening to boring talks instead you are actually physically doing things which in my opinion is the best way to learn it has lessons from maths data analysis computer science of course programming and much more all of the content on brilliant is also crafted by people who know what they are doing because there is Teachers researchers and professionals from MIT cowtech Juke Microsoft Google and more learning a little every day is one of the most important things you can do and Brilliant helps you do that with fun lessons you can do whenever you have the time and they don't have massive time commitments the platform has a ton of different content from getting familiar with python learning

day to try everything brilliant has to offer for free for a full 30 days visit brilliant.org ziger or click the first link in the description you'll also get a 20% off of an annual premium membership and now let's continue okay this is where the era of engines 2.0 came being perfectly honest those engines were kind of I mean look at them so to avoid any embarrassment I decided to try and make them again plus I was kind of forced to do another Graphics engine by my clinically insane lecturers love you really starting with the graphics engine this time I used something called openg GL to make it which at the time I'm not going to lie I hated I actually love it now but I guess we all grow as people the engine not only ran better but also kind of focused more on shaders I created things like a Fresno glow kind of a metal Shader a mission Shader even this noise Shader oh saying the word Shader so many times doesn't make it sound real anymore anyways Video available on that too now I also recreated my physics engine because honestly that one was the worst one I don't know how to explain it but this new version was just better the entire structure was much nicer I cleaned up a bunch of my C calulations particularly with the collisions so now I could have a bunch of collider objects working almost flawlessly and I added a couple new features here and there I'm currently also working on another physics engine this one is the 3.0 version so video on that soon maybe so after completing those two engines it was getting kind of boring so I decided to make well an engine again but trust this one's different drum roll please a voxal engine yeah that was kind of underwhelming so this engine was like a combination of the graphics engine base mixed in with voxos at this point I didn't know anything about voxal engines or how to make them but it ended up being a lot of fun painful but fun I am most proud of this project because it's just awesome more notably you can place and Destroy blocks structures Etc it's all procedurally generated and it has its own custom render distance system and also although it generates blocks from like y 100 to0 it only renders the top layer so that your PC isn't fighting for its life of course if you break a block it will render the ones below but it essentially only renders what you can see I also made a video on it here at this point I applied to a bunch of internships and kept practicing my C++ after some companies go back to me I attempted and completed some of their programming tests and honestly these tests taught me a lot since with some of them I didn't even know where to start I eventually got my job at Sea of Thieves and I've now completed that and I'm in my final year of University before I end this video due to popular demand many of you guys asked me about more information about sea of Thieves and my role there so here is a little talk about it oh and some random background gameplay so my role at Sea of thieves was of a software engineer intern and no that doesn't mean I run errands or hand out coffees I do actually program stuff the difference is that my load is much smaller of a non- intern plus I have less responsibilities I was in the gameplay sector so my primary jobs were programming actual gameplay stuff that the players see in the game but without breaking any ndas I did also do other things that weren't necessarily gameplay stuff about half of my time there was spent working on the legend of Monkey Island toale I'm not sure how much of that I can say but it was super fun I got to create a new weapon and some other cool stuff I'd love to actually tell you more about it and what my dayto dat was like but I can't really talk about it or at least I don't think I can because of the ndas that I signed but yeah guys this is the end of the video if you did enjoy it please leave a like And subscribe and again if you guys want to learn something new then check out Brilliance with the link below

providers which includes groc but you still can't access the groc 3 API yet and a few other things that we're going to be taking a look at as we go further into the video but for the people who do not know what client is it's an autonomous coding agent directly within your IDE capable of creating editing files executing commands using the browser and much more with your permission each step of the way now that we have that out of the way let's get started and showcase all the new highlights of part of this version 3.5 release before we get started I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis so this is where you can easily get upto-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space so definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free let's first start off with the expanded thinking incline with claw 3.7 Sonet where you have the ability to enable extended thinking and this is within the settings option option and this allows Cent to allocate separate thinking budgets for plan and act modes when you're using the cloud 3.7 Sonic model but what does this basically mean it means that client is going to be more thoughtful and strategic and this is by adjusting these budgets that will enable you to control how much reasoning power the AI dedicates to different stages of your coding process for example if you're using the plan mode they recommend that you use a higher thinking budget which is going to improve decision making strategies on your development as well as the overall project planning it's going to ensure that client carefully evaluates different approaches before it executes with the ACT mode this is where you can set a lower budget with this mode and it's going to be more suitable for quicker execution tasks like writing code modifying files or even running commands efficiently but now you have more customizable options and adaptability when you're working with this Cloud 3.7 Sonet model as you can use this expanded thinking to execute better generations with the plan mode and then have it executed with the ACT mode last week we saw the introduction of client's mCP Marketplace which is your One-Stop shop for Endless tools that you can add to client mCP servers are basically plugins that connect clients your favorite tools and enables direct AI interaction with your daily apps with just one single click within this Marketplace you can have it installed into cine and then have it powered within your workspace and have it as a companion with these different apps and now with the client version 3.5 release it brings richer more interactive mCP responses with visual content Rich displays where you have automatic image previews and this is going to enable you to see different types of images instantly without extra clicks on the web you have Rich link previews which gives you website thumbnails and detailed summaries you have enhanced tool out puts where you can actually view charts graphs as well as different visualizations directly within the chat interface of client and lastly you have seamless mode switching where you can toggle between Rich displays and plain text for a tailored experience and essentially this is making the whole approach towards mCP more intuitive more insightful and Visually engaging so it's easier for developers to use another new feature is that Klein now supports all API available grock mod models which is going to expand your AI capabilities with the two main models that grock provides excluding the grock 3 cuz it's not fully available through API yet but it will be soon but you can now access these two main models from Gro the gro 2 and the grock 2 Vision rocku is going to enable you access to its 131k token context window which is ideal for handling large code bases the gr to Vision on the other hand is going to allow you support for image analysis with with accurate pricing implementation and overall this is going to bring you deeper context understanding with powerful Vision capabilities at a cheap price so it's definitely a great add-on to now access it via clein oh they also added support for the GPT 4.5 which I don't know why you would want to use it but you can now access it through Klein now if you're looking to install Klein it's super easy to do so you can easily install it for any IDE in this case it's preferred to use vs code but you can use cursor wi surf or any of the other ones that are out there and once you have installed an ID you can head over to Microsoft's Marketplace and you can go ahead and click on install and it'll open it up within your IDE you can then go over to the marketplace stop and you can go ahead and install this now since I have it already installed I'm going to need to go ahead and update it to the latest release to access the new features so go ahead and update it and then restart the extension and then you can go over to client and then access the new update a feature I didn't mention is that if you go over to the settings tab you can go over to advanced settings and you can head over to the section that says uh preferred language and this is where you can set your language to whatever preferred language that is available from Spanish all the way to something like Portuguese so you can go ahead and set this and then have the responses I'll put it in that language to give you a rough idea of what you can do with mCP servers had head over to the marketplace and what you can actually do is look through all the different types of plugins and essentially you have different categories from browser automation all the way to something like virtualization so let's go over to all categories and let's take a look at something that we can easily get started with something that comes straight to my mind is integration of super base or subase you can go ahead and click install and this will allow you to easily integrate the inte ation of sub base within client so that's it's easier for you to set up full stack apps with this extension so it makes the process of creating databases as well as authentification systems quite easily with this plugin so after it autonomously installs mCP server for me we can then go ahead and access it so it looks like it is now set up so in this case what you can do is you can have user management controlled within client you have SSO configuration as well as authenication control so what you can do is you can say show me the latest uh databased schemas in your sub based project and it will actually give you a list of all that and you can also ask it something like list all the public tables or public schemas we can ask at that and it'll actually give us insights on this as it will use the mCP server so you can see it is using the Subways mpcp server and it's going to be able to list out all the tables for tables and Views in schema as well as their sizes if you like this video and would love to support the channel you can consider donating to my Channel Through the super thanks option below or you can

Json file it works seamlessly with tools like superbase figma cloudfare and so many others which is going to make the agent even more powerful and versatile now just to give you some context on why I really wanted to make this video is because this is something that is capable of working with large code bases cursor might not cut it in terms of its context limit which is set to around 10K tokens but with augment code and now with its agenta capabilities it's able to handle projects with tens of thousands of lines effortlessly and this is thanks to its blazing fast indexing now that's why I really wanted to make a video on this cuz now we know that it had the capability of large context uh awareness but with its uh new feature of having uh this ageny capability it's going to make it even more effortless and it's going to be even easier and faster to work with indexing before we get started I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis so this is where you can easily get upto-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space so definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free to get started it's really simple you just need to have it installed within your IDE I'm going to be installing it with Visual Studio code and what you can do is head over to the augment code website which is a link that I'll leave in the description below and you can simply click install now this will then go ahead and make you create an account which is completely for free then you can go ahead and download the extension for whatever ID you would like so in this case I'm going to do it for vs code so I'm going to select this and then open it up within my IDE and then I can go ahead and install this extension which is free so once it has finished installing I can then go ahead and access it on the left hand panel let me just showcase something in general this is where I'm going to go ahead and create a code editor on its own with the agenta capabilities of augment we're going to create a project and now you can see that it is now going to go ahead and start building within that so what we can do now is go within the chat interface and select agent now you can either set this on auto run but we're going to go ahead and keep this on agent mode and this is where we can now go ahead and have it work on creating anything so now you can see that within this interface we can go ahead and give it natural language instructions like creating a simple AI editor now we can go ahead and send in this prompt and you can see that the augment agent is going to go ahead and work on creating this so it can make and uh execute terminal based commands which you see over here you're going to be able to add and provide context you can even uh have it so that you can provide context to specific files so we can have it so that it could add multiple files or it could add a fullon workspace that has a larger Contex size than cursor which is just impressive but let's see what it ends up working on after it autonomously executes these things you can see right now it is going to start working on the project setup so we can go ahead and approve this now what you can also do is you can set this on Auto proof so you don't need to intervene and it can execute all these commands autonomously which is something that I wouldn't really recommend cuz you would want to oversight have some sort of oversight over all the code that is being generated now you can see that it is working on indexing the code base which is just insane cuz it's capable of now having memory which will then have it reference the past interactions for future generation and there we go augment agent was capable of autonomously creating this AI code editor and you can see that I'm actually able to use this functional editor where it can run scripts can change different formats you can also have it so that there's different languages that you can work with now this was all capable because of augment agent using its prior context that I had uploaded as well as having the ability to autonomously execute everything within its own terminal if you like this video and would love to support the channel you can consider donating to my channel through the super thanks option below or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on a monthly basis plus daily AI news and exclusive content plus a lot more overall I definitely believe that this is a great alternative to cursor and it actually beats it thanks to its free option so this is why I definitely recommend that you try it out not just because of the free option but because of the performance that it provides it is something that has a lot of features that you would see within many of these other AI coding agents like wind serves Cascade as well as a composer feature within curser so I'll leave all these links in the description below make sure you subscribe to the new channel

school get good grades get a good job   get promoted but after achieving these Milestones \nwhat's next what should you do with the money that   you've earned it seems like the focus on financial \nguidance disappears after the good job part when   it comes to Payday there is a lot of conflicting \nadvice on where you should put your money and in   what order do you pay off debt do you save \ndo you invest we are continuously fearful of   making the wrong choices so what actually is the \noptimal order for investing your money if you're   new here I'm Nisha I'm a qualified accountant \nand on this channel we talk about all things   personal finance and self-development and in \nthis video I'm going to share with you what I   personally believe is the most optimal order to \ninvest your money and set you up for the future   number one build up a safety net before you \ninvest in the stock market before you invest   in real estate before you invest in equipment for \nyour new business you want to have a safety net   this is the very first thing you want to do Focus \nnumber one before you do anything else is save one   month's worth of expense and put it into a high \ninterest savings account that you can easily ask   success whenever you need to without paying any \nfees I want to clarify something here is that   financially optimal for you to instead pay off \nyour debt before you say for an emergency fund   yes but being mathematically optimal is different \nto psychologically optimal and the psychological   comfort of knowing you have a small emergency \nfund and that you won't need to go into debt to   pay for a unexpected expense frees you from a \nlot of additional stress and this isn't money   to then spend on everyday expenses this emergency \nfund really needs to be kept away forget you even   have that out of sight start off with one month's \nexpense this will cover most small emergencies and   you can look into adding to this after you do \nthe next step first and that is paying off your   high interest debt the majority of adults are in \ndebt and we've accepted this as the norm we may   have bought a new car that we could have bought \nused we may have bought something that we didn't   even need to impress people that we don't even \nlike and one of the biggest problems with debt   is that it restricts your monthly income if you \nhave high interest debt that is eating away on   your income it massively restricts the amount \nyou can save and the amount of everything else   that you can do instead if you focus on paying \noff debt that is a tax-free risk-free guaranteed   rate of return if you have credit card debt that \nis charging you 20 then by paying off that debt   you're making a guaranteed return of 20 on that \nprinter support the interest that you'll no longer   be paying the very first High interest that you \nwant to pay off is your credit card debt forget   about meal planning forget about cutting costs in \nany other place this is where you're going to take   the biggest step towards Financial Freedom so what \nis high interest now I would Define High interest   debt as anything above eight percent interest some \npeople say six percent others say 10 the reason I   chose eight percent is because historically when \ninvesting in the stock market you can expect to   earn about 10 annually and when you adjust \nthis for inflation it's around eight percent   so to me anything above what you could earn in \nthe stock market is going to be high interest   debt but what about mortgages or other smaller \nloans usually the interest on that isn't as high   as credit card debt or overdraft fees so you can \ncontinue making the minimum payments on those and   to The Next Step instead but before we get into \nit I want to let you know that I'm doing a free   five-day money program it's going to be five days \nof videos where we cover a different topic every   day from asking for a pay rise money believes \nsaving investing and it's completely free the   launch date will be confirmed in the next few \nweeks I'm really excited for this so if you   want to know when it launches then sign up using \nthe link below with that aside number three on   my list of order is what you will hear a lot of \npersonal finance people talking about doing a step   one as it's free money how could you be saying no \nto free money but the reason why I don't think it   makes sense to put this as number one is because \nit's something that you will benefit from in 20 30   40 years from now and that doesn't matter if you \ncan't get your finances today in a good place to   start with so once you have steps one to two done \nthen you want to take the match that your employer   is offering you for your retirement fund this is \ncalled different things in different countries   in the UK it's the pension contribution and the \nUS you would have heard it as the 401K and what   this means is for every pound or dollar that \nyou contribute your employer will also match   that contribution put that towards your pension \nso say you're earning a hundred thousand and you   contribute 4 000 of that towards your workplace \nattention your employer matches everything you   put in so you're basically making 100 return \non your investment straight away remember this   is different from the full amount that you can \ncontribute all you care about here is contributing   whatever you need to get the full match because \notherwise you're just leaving free money on the   table and unfortunately for these retirement \nmatches that employers provide as a benefit   you can't claim it retrospectively so you can't \nclaim it now for previous years so you're going   to repeat this one every single year you never \nwant to miss out on this free money step number   four have an additional fund imagine the kind of \nfreedom and stability you'd have if you had three   to six months of your living expenses in your \nbank account at all times knowing that if anything   happened you lost your job your business didn't \nwork out then you would have something to fall   back onto and that will all be taken care of this \nis when you want to have enough money available so   that if anything happens you can bail yourself out \nand not rely on credit card debt to get you out of   your situation so you want to work out what is the \nabsolute minimum you need to survive on so your   fixed expenses your variable expenses your total \nexpenses for the month and then multi apply that   number by three to six months if you're employed \nor nine to twelve months if you're self-employed   this number is your emergency fund and it's \ndifferent to your safety net that we spoke   about in the first point this is for the larger \nFinancial shocks that we just mentioned that have   longer term implications now once you've done that \nthis is where it gets fun because you've completed   the groundwork for a truly free financial future \nnow you get to invest and meet some of your other   Financial priorities so the next step is to invest \nthrough a tax advantage account the reason why   you absolutely want to do this is because it's \none of the most tax efficient places you can be   putting your money in to make it grow most other \nInvestments buy some sort of tax when you buy   a share and make money from it you usually have \nto pay capital gains tax however when you invest   through a tax advantaged account such as an Isa if \nyou're in the UK or a Roth IRA if you're in the US   you Shield your profits from the tax man so you \nwant to take advantage of these accounts up until   the maximum if you can then we have a payoff low \ninterest debt this includes for example student   loans in some cases and sometimes car loans from a \nfinancial standpoint this debt may not be hurting   you as as much so you can choose whether you want \nto pay it off or instead use that money to invest   but my personal perspective is that unless this \nstep is being used to help you make more money   if it's not helping you do that then you should \nbe paying it off so if you're using that money   to invest rather than to pay it back then it \nmay make sense but if you are not paying off   your debt because you rather have more money \nleft over to spend on things that you enjoy   then I would instead consider paying off when you \nconsider debt as a normal way of life it can very   quickly Cascade into a mindset of justification \nand using it to fund an elevated lifestyle with   low interest debt is something you want to avoid \nyou want to get into the habit of paying off as   much bad debt as you can from your life then we \nhave paying off your mortgage this is the last   thing on the list and I would highlight that it is \ncompletely optional and it really really depends   on your financial situation there are so many \nvariables that you have to take into account how   much Equity do you have left when does your fixed \nrate end how long do you have left personally in   my situation I would not pay off my mortgage right \naway instead I would choose to use that money   to invest because mortgage rates are typically \nsome of the cheapest debt you can get and they   have long-term commitments that have already been \npriced in to be paid over the full term so instead   if you wait to pay off your mortgage before you \ndecide to start investing you're really limiting   your time in the investment Market that can take \naway from some of the benefits of compounding   and long-term growth and on top of that making \noverpayments can save you money on interest in the   long run for your mortgage but not all mortgages \nare flexible so before you make any overpayments   you want to make sure you check the terms of your \nmortgage and see if overpayments are allowed or if   there are any early repayment

advanced most capable most lethal aircraft ever built and experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost 5 Years and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other Nation there's no other Nation we know every other plane I've seen every one of them and it's not even close this is a Next Level leftenant General Dave deula is Dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace power studies and a senior scholar at the US Air Force Academy's Institute for future conflict welcome to DW how next level is the f47 um well well first thanks very much for having me on um it it is quite a leap ahead in the context of capability uh both in terms of low observability or what people call stealth um as well as with um range for this kind of a size of an aircraft um as well as by capitalizing on uh the kinds of technologies that uh give us EDG is in terms of sensing information and then processing that information um what I like to tell people is that the f-47 will not just be a fighter um it will be able to do much more than just shoot missiles and drop bombs but can actually conduct multiple missions uh by penetrating highly defended airspace collecting information processing it and then Pro sending back that information to um Allied and Coalition military commanders in order for them to make decisions faster than the enemy can react so um it's a it adds a type of decision superiority that other aircraft simply can't and as I understand it it it features an AI cop pilot and will be assisted by a swarm of AI powered drones so so AI very much at the the heart of this technology well that is certainly part of it much of the the drones that you're speaking of here uh in the United States Air Force are referred to is collaborative combat aircraft and those are still under design right now and you're correct they will rely to a great degree on artificial intelligence um and machine learning and those concepts are being developed the notion is this whole concept of Next Generation air dominance isn't just the f47 but it's also working with um the uh other autonomous aircraft these collaborative combat aircraft so that we can achieve a degree of um you know man machine teeming um that otherwise uh we wouldn't have President Trump said he'd be selling a toned down version of the f-47 uh to America's allies which is hardly going to inspire confidence in potential buyers well what I would tell you is um I don't know I mean he obviously um has plans um you know even a quote toned down version may be significantly more capable than any of the other aircraft combat aircraft that are currently out there but look that's speculation um I think that's yet to be determined um and we'll see how this evolves um so you know one doesn't anticipate that this aircraft will become operational um in the immediate future so a lot of this depends upon when the f47 actually does become operational Boeing beat lucky Martin to this contract Boeing which of course has had these problems over the last few years with bits and pieces dropping off its planes in the sky and there was also talk of compromises in its in its uh quality assurance processes so this sounds like a a a big boost in confidence in them as a manufacturer um interesting point that many you know much of the discussion here um follows along those same lines I would just uh caution your audience that you know there are Boeing is an enormous company um and there are different different segments of the company in the commercial aircraft division is different than um the uh Phantom works or the defense section of the company uh and so you know we we'll see those are different organizations um and it's it it really one has to be careful not to associate uh perhaps what went on in one segment of the company with the defense sector and Bo beat locked Martin to this uh contract loed builds a current F35 fighter jet which Elon Musk has described as an expensive and complex jack of all trades and master of none how close to the truth is his assessment um his statement reflects a degree of lack of understanding uh as well as uh hope not reality with respect to um uninhabited aerial vehicles that doesn't mean that we shouldn't aspire to the promise of uninhabited aerial vehicles but with respect to the F35 let me remind you and your audience um that us produced f-35s launched by the Israelis just a couple of months ago flew over a thousand miles penetrated Into the Heart of Iran and just didn't avoid the most capable Russian surface to air missile systems but destroyed them along with other critical targets and return back without any losses there's no drone or uninhabited aircraft that can do that to today and so the proof is in the pudding right um and so Mr musk needs to consider all of the elements not just what he wish might be the case um so as president Trump announced the the f47 we also have Canada and Portugal announcing that they're reviewing deals to buy the F35 because of the Trump administration's stance towards its International Partners how big a blow would cancellation of those contracts be well right now um the United States has um upwards I believe we're at 20 uh different National Partners flying the F-35 uh so you know that is yet to be determined and I wouldn't make the leap yet that look let me put it this way every nation has the right to take stock of what it might invest in but when you look at the ations that have already invested in the F-35 um it's certainly an extraordinarily desirable aircraft um that partners and allies want to be able to attain and there's also another strength in partners and allies operating the same kind of equipment um and that's that it brings our Nations closer together so you know I'll leave the politics to the politicians uh but it is an extraordinarily capable aircraft and there are huge advant advantages from a strategic perspective uh in more and more partners and Friends acquiring them okay good talking to you thank you so much for joining us Le tenant General Dave deul from the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace power studies thank you thank you", "duration(in seconds)": 566.0, "region": "US"}}

Now, stick around to the end of the video to watch Marjorie Taylor Green get triggered by Crockett's comments. I now recognize Miss Crockett from Texas for five minutes. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. Are we tired of winning yet? We are hugely winning. We have the best of the best. Right. Wrong. That was sarcasm if you didn't catch it. Um the fact is we should never have partisan politics playing a role when we're talking about something such as science. But unfortunately in today's times, Democrats believe in scientists and experts and data and Republicans instead believe in conspiracy theorist. And right now, that is who we have leading one of the most important agencies in this country is a conspiracy theorist, not someone who has an actual resume to get the job done. So, why would anyone trust the Republicans on anything, let alone matters of public health and safety? It has taken Texas largest measles outbreak in 30 years with more than 500 confirmed cases and the death of two children for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to say what we already knew. The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine. This is the same guy who chaired the antivax nonprofit Children's Health Defense. Just last month, during an interview with Fox News, he suggested that somehow being infected with measles could provide protection against cancer and heart disease. The Republicans are implementing the most dangerous public health agenda in modern American history, and people are literally dying as a result. This administration doesn't believe in science. They're firing thousands of scientists and public health officials who keep our food and medicine safe. Slashing funding for scientific agencies that help cities and states respond to public health emergencies, limiting public access to research and data that contradicts their misinformation. They're using financial threats to manipulate which studies the government will sponsor, and blocking researchers from diversifying clinical trials. This reckless and chaotic approach will make it more difficult for the FDA to achieve its mission of protecting the public health of Americans. But there are two issues that I want to address before my time expires. Staffing at FDA has long been a challenge. The Government Accountability Office has identified several challenges at FDA as high-risk issues. One of the bigger issues the GAO has identified as FDA's extensive workload. Last Congress, the Senate held a hearing on the sale of unauthorized and illegal vaping products and ecigarettes. During the hearing, Dr. Brian King, director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, testified that the volume of pre-market tobacco product applications is overwhelming. So FDA is instead prioritizing its enforcement responsibilities when it comes to ecigarettes products. But just last week, Trump not only fired the director of FDA's tobacco center, he closed two entire offices responsible for drafting new tobacco regulations and setting policies. Dr. Kesler in its 2025 high-risk report, GAO stated that quote, \"Stable senior FDA and center leadership remains of vital importance to the agency. How will this vacuum of leadership impact the public health and safety of Americans?\" It will put Americans at risk. But you, Congresswoman, you raised a very, very important point. I'm the only pediatrician on this panel today. And your constituents, please, the most important thing is what you said. If you want to prevent measles, please have your children vaccinated against that very dangerous disease. Thank you so much for that, Doc. And I only got 56 seconds and I don't know if I'm going to go through my last question because you just I'm looking to Greg to see if he gonna make me do it. Listen, I I'm I'mma go off instead. Um, sorry. I appreciate the fact that you are an expert in this and here's the reality. Um, the Republicans and definitely MAGA loves to troll me in so many ways. Um, and the reality is that I trust and believe experts. I don't believe that I know everything. I believe that I was elected by my constituents to make sure that I could keep them safe in all ways. Making sure that they are not going to be victimized if they have, say, family members that are serving abroad because of Signal Gate because of that incompetence. Making sure that they have access to vaccines if they need it. Making sure that they can actually provide for their family because we have real economists that are the general lady's time is whether or not we are inad tariff war. Gentle lady's time is expired. I now recognize Mr. Fallon from Texas for 5 minutes. Of course, I had to leave Marjorie Taylor Green banging her gavvel there, using the only little power she has to try to get back at Jasmine Crockett, who made point after point about how Republicans love the conspiracy theories, love the conspiracy theorists like Marjgerie Taylor Green, and refuse to listen to science and facts and data. like Democrats do. Now, talking about RFK Jr., uh it's really important to remember that the guy made numerous comments about how vaccines are unsafe in the years leading up to his presidential bid and then used that bid to try to land a position as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for either Kamla and Donald Trump. He approached both campaigns and Kamla told him that he can go kick rocks, but not Donald Trump. Donald Trump instead chose him to be the secretary of HHS. And now, because RFK Jr. doesn't want an outbreak of measles on his hands. He's now saying that the measles vaccine is the best way to prevent your child from getting measles. And now people who listen to him talk about how vaccines might cause autism and how they're unsafe. Well, now he's singing a different tune because RFK Jr. will blow whatever way the wealth winds take him. He's very vorious. He only cares about power and money. And that's the real issue here. It's not so much that he's a conspiracy theorist. It's that he's the cabinet secretary of health and human services and can make decisions based on the money. And if you don't know anything about health and human services, there's a lot of money when it comes to the American health care system. So, Jasmine Crocky here pointing all of this out is fantastic, but she also started to uncover the defunding of public health organizations that Donald Trump is conducting from the White House. And so we see things like, you know, we're focused on things like RFK Jr. being the conspiracy theorist and Donald Trump's tariffs and the defunding of federal government programs uh at the hands of people like Elon Musk and Doge and Donald Trump. But what Jasmine Crockett is doing here is so important because there's so many layers to uh the the impacts of what this defunding means. for the federal government. And so while what's on the surface is deeply troubling, what's underneath it is also very scary and and that should really alarm a lot of us and and wake a lot of us up to the problems that we're going to need to fix once Donald Trump and Republicans are out of power. Let me know what your thoughts are on Jasmine Crockett's comments in the comments down below. And be sure to subscribe to Reflect Politics so that you get my future videos delivered straight to you.

If you thought \nthe English language couldn't take any   more abuse after watching Donald Trump's latest \npublic appearance, just you wait. This week,   a flood of Wall Street analysts and institutional \nfund managers basically said out loud what many of   us have been wondering about for years. Donald \nTrump might not just be wrong on this whole   tariff thing. He might be mentally unwell. Not \nmy words. This is a direct quote from financial   research firm FS Insights, whose founder Tom \nLee said that there are fund managers now   fearing that the president is, quote, insane. \nCheck this out. Quote, in the last few days,   we have had many conversations with macro fund \nmanagers and their concern is that the White   House is not acting rationally, but rather on \nGeology and some even fear that this may not even   be ideology. A few have quietly wondered if the \npresident might be insane. This is not just snark.   This is people whose job is to make money under \nany administration and they are publicly sounding   the alarm because Trump's latest economic \ndecisions make zero sense unless you're either   deliberately trying to destroy market confidence. \nYou've lost touch with reality or it's an insider   trading pump and dump scheme, the likes of \nwhich Senator Adam Schiff wants to investigate.   Trump dropped new tariffs on China, 125% because \nwhy not China fired back with their own tariffs   and then in classic Trump fashion, as we talked \nabout yesterday, he abruptly reverse his course   and pauses most tariffs except on China announcing \na flat 10% baseline tariff instead. But it's   paused. The result is of course pure market chaos. \nMarkets crashed, spiked Trump declared victory,   even though it was only a partial recovery. Then \nanother disaster down 1500 points S and P up 7%   in minutes when the pause is announced whiplash \nand sort of a bipolar nature doesn't even start   to describe it. Tom Lee calls it a binary outcome \npresidency. Either Trump guesses right and this   somehow works out or the economy explodes. that \nthere's no in between. There's no planning.   There is no structure. There was no economic \nmodeling of the things that are being pushed   by this administration. And that might be the most \nterrifying part that this might not be ideology.   This might merely be, and I say merely almost \nlike it wouldn't be as bad, but it's actually   very bad. This might merely be impulsive, erratic, \nincreasingly detached behavior from a guy holding   the global economy. in a Twitter thumb, for lack \nof a better term, an X thumb. And it is not just   left-wing economists waving red flags. You've \ngot people all over the place. I mean, you know,   Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase said he thinks \na recession is likely a billionaire Trump donor.   Bill Ackman called it an economic nuclear war \nthat could take decades to recover from. Elon   Musk split with Trump earlier this week and said \nhe wants zero tariffs and he's against the trade   war altogether. even right wing media darling \nBen Shapiro said the tariffs are no good. He   said much more than that. Ted Cruz urged Trump \nto take a deal. Barstool Sports's Dave Portnoy,   not a bleeding heart liberal, said he's down \nseven million dollars and can't understand what   the hell is going on. So we should be clear \nthat this is not like a leftist fever dream.   This is Trump's own allies saying what has \nbecome very obvious. He doesn't know what he's   doing. There's no master plan. And increasingly, \npeople are starting to wonder, is Trump capable   of even understanding what he is doing? Now, \nmeanwhile, while the markets were melting down,   Trump was on troth central doing what he always \ndoes when things go south. You know, be cool,   start buying stocks right now. Weirdly joking \nabout the size of Adam Schiff's neck and head,   not an exaggeration. While major global economies \nwere retaliating with tariffs on soybeans, beef,   car parts, Trump was riffing about whether it's \ncrooked Joe or sleepy Joe. And does Adam Schiffs   head look more like a watermelon or a papaya? \nAnd meanwhile, ISIS comparing mass deportations   to Amazon Prime deliveries. Not a joke. And \nhalf of the lawyers in Trump's own DOJ are   resigning rather than defending this insanity in \ncourt. This is just what governance looks like   in 2025. Erratic economic policy \npurges at the DOJ, mass deportations,   personal insults and a stock market that's \nlike a seesaw, mostly down, mostly done. So,   I don't know, maybe if you're a billionaire \nhedge fund manager. And you're wondering if   the president has lost his mind. It's no longer \npolitical. It's just survival instincts at this   point. But this is exactly what we predicted. It's \nauthoritarian. It's incompetent. It's deranged.   It's a lot of things.

SHE IS ALSO CO-FOUNDER OF THE  EMERGENCY SAVINGS FIRM SECURE  SAVE SUZE, IT IS ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE  YOU. WELCOME. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE I-BONDS WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT,  BUTMY NEPHEW-IN-LAW SAID YOU HAVE TO GET THESE I-BONDS. EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THEY ARE, HOW THEY WORK, HOW I BUY THEM AND  FROM WHOM. >> NOW SO YOU BUY THEM FROM THE  TREASURY, DIRECTLY FROM THEM SO YOU GO FROM TREASURYDIRECT.GOV IT IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU  CAN BUY THEM, NUMBER ONE THEY RANGE IN PRICE. YOU CAN INVEST FROM $25 ALL OF THE WAY UP TO A MAXIMUM PER  PERSON OF $10,000, ALTHOUGH  THERE ARE WAYS TO DO IT WHERE  YOU CAN PUT IN UP TO 30,000 IF YOU HAVE A TRUST AND/OR A  BUSINESS WHEN YOU INVEST IN AN I-BOND, I  STANDS FOR INFLATION, YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR ONE  YEAR YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR MONEY AND THE REASON IS FROM THE TIME  YOU PUT IT IN TO ONE YEAR YOU  CANNOT TOUCH IT. FROM YEAR TWO TO FIVE THERE IS ONLY A THREE-MONTH INTEREST  PENALTY. THAT IS HOW THEY WORK. THEY ARE ATTACHED TO CPI SO RIGHT NOW WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IN MAY, THE CPI THE YIELD ON THE SERIES I BONDS WERE GUARANTEED AND ANNUALIZED AND IT'S  GUARANTEED TO YOU SO THEY CHANGE EVERY SIX MONTHS THE INTEREST RATE CHANGES EVERY  MAY AND NOVEMBER SO FROM MAY UNTIL NOVEMBER EVERYBODY WHO BUYS ONE RIGHT NOW WILL BE GUARANTEED AN ANNUALIZED YIELD OF 9.62% STATE INCOME  TAX-FREE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THAT FOR SIX MONTH, BUT  THAT'S STILL 4.81% ON YOUR MONEY. WHEN THEY RESET COME NOVEMBER, LET'S SAY THEY RESET EVEN LOWER. LET'S SAY THEY RESET AT 7.11 WHICH IS WHAT THEY WERE PAYING BEFORE THEY RAISED TO 9.62, YOU  ARE GUARANTEED THAT FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS ON AN ANNUALIZED  YIELD SO THAT'S, LIKE, 3.56%,  HALF OF THAT FOR SIX MONTH BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GUARANTEED SO FOR THE YEAR IT'S 8.37% THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW THEY  WORK THEY'RE FABULOUS THEIR MATURITIES ARE FOR -- GO ON >> I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU THOSE NUMBERS THAT YOU JUST -- AND I GET IT, YOU EXPLAINED IT PERFECTLY. THEY RESET EVERY SIX MONTHS AND  ARE YOU GUARANTEED UNDER THIS  PROGRAM TO MAKE A YIELD IF YOU HOLD THE BONDS THAT IS ABOVE THE THEN-PREVAILING RATE OF  INFLATION? >> SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU ARE  ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED, AND WHAT'S SO GREAT IS THAT THE ONLY WAY A FINANCE PERSON CAN EVER  USE THE WORD GUARANTEE SIDE  USUALLY WITH A TREASURY  INSTRUMENT BECAUSE IT'S  GUARANTEED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NO COMMISSIONS OR ANYTHING SO ONCE THEY DECLARE THAT RATE ON MAY 1st AND NOVEMBER 1st YOU  ARE GUARANTEED FOR WHENEVER YOU  BUY IT BETWEEN THOSE PERIODS,  FOR SIX MONTHS YOU ARE GUARANTEE THE RATE THAT THEY DECLARED. AGAIN, THAT'S AN ANNUALIZED  YIELD, SO IT'S ONLY REALLY GUARANTEED FOR SIX MONTHS UNTIL  THEY RESET YOU KNOW, TYLER, I GAVE A MASTER CLASS ON THIS ON THE WOMEN AND MONEY PODCAST ON THE APRIL 17th  EDITION OF IT. EVERYBODY SHOULD LISTEN TO IT  BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU ALL THE INs AND OUTs, EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS IS AN INVESTMENT. I'VE BEEN DOING THESE SINCE  2001 >> THIS DOES MAKE AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE YOU EXPLAINED IT VERY WELL IN  YOUR FIRST ANSWER IN TALKING ABOUT THE 9.6% RATE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT DOES CLEAR THE LEVEL OF INFLATION,  BUT IF INFLATION IS SOMETHING  LIKE 8.6%, AREN'T YOU MORE OR  LESS JUST PROTECTING THE VALUE OF YOUR MONEY RATHER THAN REALLY GROWING IT EVEN IF INFLATION IS  ONLY APERCENT LESS THAN WHAT YOU'RE MAKING. >> COURTNEY, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, BUT DON'T YOU WANT IN MARKETS  LIKE THIS TO HAVE A POSITION OF  YOUR MONEY ABSOLUTELY RO TEKTED? WHERE ARE YOUGOING TO GO YOU CAN'T GO TO REGULAR BONDS, BECAUSE BONDS IF YOU ADOPTED IN  BOND FUNDS FOR GROWTH, YOU'RE  DOWN 10% OR 15%. YOU'RE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE STOCK MARKET THERE HAS GOT TO BE A PORTION OF YOUR MONEY, WHATEVER THAT IS THAT YOU WANT PROTECTED, YOU WANT ESSENTIALLY IN CASH AT  LEAST WHERE IT'S KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT  THIS WILL DO VERSUS YOU'RE IN A  MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT OR A CD OR  WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU'RE  GETTING 3% WHERE YOU'RE LOSING MONEY. SO THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO PUT  YOUR -- YOU MENTIONED AFTER FIVE YEARS, YOU MENTIONED 27 YEAR IS  PUT FOR 30 YEARS >> I SEE, AND YOU CAN REDEEM THEM ANY TIME AFTER THE FIRST  YEAR FROM THE YEAR TWO THROUGH FIVE THERE IS A THREE-MONTH  INTEREST PENALTY AFTER THE FIFTH YEAR YOU CAN REDEEM ANY -- YOU CAN REDEEM ANY TIME.  >> WITHOUT ANY PEVNALTIES WHEN S EVER REALLY, ESSENTIALLY. SO YOU'RE IN THERE FOR A YEAR  AND YOU REDEEM AFTER THAT, BIG DEAL.  >> FINAL QUESTION WHICH COURTNEY TOUCHED ON AND THAT IS THAT THIS IS FOR A PORTION OF YOUR MONEY,  IDEALLY MONEY YOU DON'T NEED TO  TOUCH. IN SOME WAYS LIKE STOCKS, BUT  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS  WITH THIS KIND OF SAFETY MONEY AN OPPORTUNITY COST WHICH IS TO  SAY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE YOUR  GROWTH MONEY THE STOCK MARKET MIGHT RETURN  YOU OVER THE FIVE YEARS OR THE TEN YEARS YOU HOLD THIS BOND MUCH MORE THAN 8%, 9%, A LITTLE  ABOVE INFLATION, RIGHT YOUR GROWTH MONEY IS A DIFFERENT THING. >> ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE GROWTH MONEY. YOU HAVE EMERGENCY SAVINGS ACCOUNT MONEY THAT WOULD NEVER GO INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOCK THAT UP FOR A YEAR, BUT YOU DO HAVE A PORTION OF YOUR MONEY THAT YOU WANT RIGHT NOW SAFE AND SOUTHBOUND BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS  SO FREAKED, AND AT THESE INTEREST RATES, IF INFLATION CONTINUES THESE ARE A BIG  WINNER BIG, BIG, BIG. >> WHAT'S THE PODCAST AGAIN, GO  BA", "duration(in seconds)": 435.0, "region": "US"}}

The fate of the global economy and financial markets hinges in large part on whether the US and China can find a way to avoid a protracted trade war. Trump has hit China with tariffs of 145% on most goods since taking office, prompting Beijing to retaliate and threatening to wipe out most trade between the world's biggest economies. \n\nJanet Henry spoke to Bloomberg Radio's Stephen Carroll and Valerie Tytel as Bloomberg Economics calculated that US importers have borne almost 100% of the tariffs , with little offset from their counterparts across the border, through March. Tariff costs have been passed on to US importers at the border, and profit margins for US firms appear set to take a hit.\n\n--------\r\nWatch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube\r\nWeekdays 7am-6pm ET\r\nWATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF\r\n \r\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/BloombergRadio\r\n\r\nSubscribe to our Podcasts:\r\n\r\n    Bloomberg Daybreak: http://bit.ly/3DWYoAN\r\n    Bloomberg Surveillance: http://bit.ly/3OPtReI\r\n    Bloomberg Intelligence: http://bit.ly/3YrBfOi\r\n    Balance of Power: http://bit.ly/3OO8eLC\r\n    Bloomberg Businessweek: http://bit.ly/3IPl60i\r\n\r\nListen on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto with the Bloomberg Business app:\r\nApple CarPlay: https://apple.co/486mghI\r\nAndroid Auto: https://bit.ly/49benZy\r\n \r\nVisit our YouTube channels:\r\nBloomberg Podcasts: https://www.youtube.com/bloombergpodcasts\r\nBloomberg Television: https://www.youtube.com/@markets\r\nBloomberg Originals: https://www.youtube.com/bloomberg\r\nQuicktake: https://www.youtube.com/@BloombergQuicktake", "tags": "Donald Trump, Janet Henry, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, Stephen Carroll, Tariff War, Trump Tariff Pause, US economy, United States Government, Valerie Tytel, Xi Jinping, donald trump tariffs, tariff, tariffs, trump tariffs", "script": "Tariffs are bad for growth and the\nuncertainty is very, very bad for growth.\nAnd we now have a higher cost of capital because equities are lower and bond\nyields are higher than they were. So that will weigh on investment\nspending and and on decision making. This is going to be a weaker period for\nfor hiring. So certainly we are looking for the\nunemployment rate to rise. And and we think that that will also\nmean especially with higher inflation from from tariff prices, the real\nincomes will be squeezed. So it's not just investment spending\nthat will be weaker, but with employment, weaker consumer spending\ngrowth will be weaker as well. So, yes, the these tariffs are going to\ntake a significant toll on growth. We're not going to see anything like the\nkind of growth rate, even if we're not forecasting a deep recession.\nDo you see the impact as being more time limiting?\nWhat are the kind of long term parts of that that could actually drag sort of as\nwe think further into the future? Well, I think that's that's the key\nquestion in all of this. How long does this last?\nYou know, this isn't a kind of one off adjustment in tariffs if it was 10% on\neveryone indefinitely, because that's how we're going to raise revenues.\nAnd it all happens in April. Then a year later, it drops out and you\nhaven't got this ongoing uncertainty. But the stop start nature and the fear\nthat on a daily basis you wake up in the morning and not wondering whether which\nsectors are going to have 25% tariffs, which countries tariffs are going to be\nat 100%. That's where the damage is caused.\nAnd we know that there is a broader point to this.\nThe intention of the US President is to relocate manufacturing to the US, but\nmanufacturing only accounts for less than 10% of U.S.\nemployment. Is the damage that would be caused on\nthe other 90% of employment from that much weaker spending.\nBut also, he really does want to significantly reduce the relationship\nbetween the U.S. and China, and that's where there will\nbe knock on impacts within the rest of the world.\nAnd I think it is it is longer term, you know, certainly for the next two years\nahead of the midterm elections and there will be significant shifts in global\ntrading relationships, reconfigurations. And look what's already happened in\nterms of triggering more policy stimulus in China and in Europe.\nAnd that's not going into reverse. Now, you know, the European rearmament\nand I guess the realization in Europe that they need to do more to support\ndomestic demand in their own economies. This is medium term.\nIt's not just something that's going to be resolved in a few weeks or indeed 90\ndays. Janet, on relocating trade or perhaps\nrebalancing the economy. I'm having a hard time getting my head\nwrapped around what are the effects of a narrowing trade deficit if if Trump gets\ngets that, if that's what he's after? I mean, we're still confused if that's\nreally what he wants. But let's say the trade deficit does\nnarrow. Does that necessarily entail there'll be\nless investment, you know, via capital account inflows into the U.S.\nAnd does that worry you or is that off the mark?\nWell, he's not going to balance the budget.\nThe trade deficit. Balancing the trade deficit would take a\nmulti-year recession, which is actually what happened in the 1930s when tariffs\nwere at this level. But I think there is an inconsistency of\nwhat he's trying to deliver. You cannot have a much narrower trade\ndeficit and have lower bond yields and have a weaker dollar.\nThat is an possible shouldn't have a have a government deficit of 8% of GDP.\nRight. That something has to break there.\nAbsolutely. He will have to decide, you know, what\nare his major priorities. And also, as much as countries are\nqueuing up apparently to say that they will invest more in the U.S.\nand we've had announcements from Japan and Taiwan, actually, if you are\ninvesting now and remember, a lot of countries have been investing in the\nU.S. for the last three years, helped by the\nInflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act.\nBut now if you're building plant in the U.S., you're paying tariffs on a lot of\nthe building materials and other areas that you are doing.\nSo he is making the costs of producing in the U.S.\nmore expensive and therefore making a lot of U.S.\nindustry a lot less competitive in global markets.\nIt's all about the domestic market. And you're right, there will be less\nfinancial flows into the U.S., particularly if there are\nother viable investment opportunities. If the U.S.\nnow is the budget deficit, the current account deficit, then there'll be less\nforeign savings to be reinvested into U.S.\nTreasuries. Where does that money go, I suppose, is\nthe next question. If if we're seeing this move away from\nthe U.S., is Europe attractive enough for that?\nWill the Chinese stimulus measures help to drive kind of greater growth from\nthere? Where do you see that rebalancing\nbenefiting? Well, if the U.S.\ndoes succeed in narrowing its external balances, then that means the the\nexternal surpluses elsewhere in the world.\nSo they're kind of excess. Savings that used to all go into the\nU.S. Actually, they'll be they'll be less of\nit. Also, in Europe, there will be more\ndemands on those European savings. And I think this is what we'll even hear\nfrom the ECB today is about the role of fiscal.\nWe know that at the moment inflation's going to be lower, that we are going to\nsee, you know, perhaps diversion of trade flows.\nWe're seeing the stronger euro, we're seeing the lower oil price on the\ninflation side. But over the medium term now, and\nparticularly as we go into 2026, you are going to see a lot of these savings\ngoing into European investments. And a lot of it will be whether it's the\nGerman infrastructure spending, the European rearmament.\nAnd there's still a lot of credibility in U.S.\ninstitutions in terms of perhaps not the same yields that you got out of the\nU.S., but you don't have the same growth outperformance in the U.S..\nUncertainty. And and, you know, I guess conviction\nthat the U.S. dollar is going to be persistently\nstrong. Now, the euro's actually a bit stronger.", "duration(in seconds)": 365.0, "region": "US"}}

launch, raywilliamjohnson, ray william johnson, rwj", "script": "so this guy is going to launch himself into space in a homemade rocket to prove to everyone that the Earth is flat now his name is Mad Mike and Mad Mike has always been a risk taker he used to race motorbikes as a young teen and he eventually became a pro motorcycle racer for a while but all that thrill seeking that's just not enough for Mad Mike he wants more he wants to become the world's greatest Daredevil but unfortunately right now he can't because he's just a working man in fact he's a limo driver in Las Vegas but then one day in 2002 he gets an idea why not break a world record and he decides to take his limousine that he uses for work and drive it up a ramp and jump it as far as it will go and basically create a world record for how far he can jump a limo and he does at the local Speedway he sets it all up and he jumps his limousine a whole ass 103 ft and he sets a Guinness World Record and about a year later he tries again to break his own world record by jumping a new limo 125 ft this time though unfortunately the limo crashes to the ground early and poor Mad Mike gets no world record this time but that doesn't matter to him he still holds his original record so basically he got what he wanted and people now know him as a daredevil and he's happy with that until he here's the thing about Mad Mike jumping limos is great but it's still not enough of a thrill for him and if he's going to be the world's greatest Daredevil he needs to go bigger and that is when he gets another idea he wants to build a homemade rocket and fly higher than anyone has ever flown before in a homemade rocket here's the problem with this idea though other than the fact that it's reallying dangerous the problem with this idea is that he doesn't exactly know how to build a homemade rocket and he's never built something like like this before so he eventually teams up with another guy who does build amateur Rockets this guy Waldo and together Mike and Waldo they're going to build this thing and they're going to do it on a budget cuz you know they're kind of broke and so they design a cheap version of a rocket one that runs on water more specifically it runs on Steam because steam is cheap to make while actual Rocket Fuel is not and so they work on this rocket and they build it out of a bunch of scrap parts and eventually in 2014 boom they finish it and Mad Mike calls it the X2 Sky limo and it's just a little guy I mean here's a picture of Mike standing next to it and here it is on its ramp and so now it's finally time to launch it and one day on some land out in Arizona they actually do Mad Mike he gets all ready and he gets in it and they countdown and boom it takes off and this homemade rocket flies around 1,370 Ft before Mike pulls his parachute to end the flight and then one of the parachutes doesn't end up opening and then pow the rocket Falls and lands pretty hard and Mad Mike ends up getting injured and for the next two weeks he has to move around with a walker but you know he eventually recovers regardless he got what he wanted he successfully launched himself in a homemade rocket and he's content now uh actually no he's not quite the opposite at this point Mad Mike's desire to be the world's greatest Daredevil gets even worse which means not only does he want to go up again but he wants to go higher which means he and Waldo will have to build a new rocket here's the problem with that though they're out of funds now I mean even though they're making Rockets out of spare parts I mean these things still cost money to build and so Mike gets yet another idea why not launch a fundraiser and so he does he makes a Kickstarter to raise money like I'm going to launch myself over 2,000 ft in the air in a homemade rocket please donate but unfortunately of the $150,000 he was hoping to raise he only raises a whopping $310 so that failed but oh Mike he's never out of ideas and he certainly isn't going to give up now so then he decides to do something kind of brilliant he starts pandering to Flat earthers saying that he's one of them and he like really plays into this bit like he starts talking about it publicly I believe the world is a different shape than what we were taught in those programming centers which is called public school system and so he starts telling the Flat Earth Community all this stuff that he wants to launch a homemade rocket into space or nearly into space so that once he's up there he can observe and take pictures and see that the Earth is not a sphere but that it's actually flat and this will prove that the flat earthers have been right about the shape of the world this whole time and because he's going to do that that they should help him raise money for this project to First do a smaller launch and that eventually at some point he'll do a much bigger launch all the way into space I mean he's totally bullshitting them but it doesn't matter flat earthers believe him who would have thought flat earthers would be so gullible anyway so the flat earthers believe him and they set up a GoFundMe for him and through that he raises about $8,500 which isn't a ton but it is enough to help him build his next rocket and so he and Waldo they build a new rocket and here's a picture of of it and you can see that it says Flat Earth on the side then in 2018 they go launch again Mike gets in it and they go ahead and boom it takes off and this launch is also successful and you can see it reaches 1,875 ft and you can see the little parachutes coming out and he eventually gets to the ground safely now just to be clear this launch wasn't supposed to reach space this was supposed to be a smaller launch first to raise awareness for a much bigger ger space launch later but whatever Mike fleeced the Flat Earth community and he beat his previous launch height by 500 feet and that's pretty damn good oh but it's not good for Mike not good enough he still wants to be the world's greatest Daredevil and so he has to go again and now at this point there have got to be people around him saying like Mike you don't have to do this I mean you've launched yourself more than once bro you have proven yourself you're a daredevil every one knows it but Mike he's still determined not only that after this last launch he's suddenly getting all kinds of media attention from this like he's doing interviews on TV a film crew from the Science channel has started following him around documenting his work for a TV series called homemade astronauts he even gets featured on an episode of Tosh.0 and Tosh the host comedian doesn't actually believe that Mike thinks the Earth is flat and he kind of calls him out on it and I believe it is flat I believe you don't believe that and you just want a free trip to space anyway so Mike and Waldo put another rocket together and this is actually their best looking one yet and if you zoom into the photo it looks like he actually got some sponsors to pay for this one so that's cool well however he did it finally the big day comes and this is going to be his greatest launch yet and the Science Channel crew is there filming for the TV show and about 50 other people show up to watch and document the whole thing so mad Mike he gets prepared and you can see him here climbing into the rocket and he straps in and they ready the launch they countdown and boom mike and the rocket blasts off into the air however something goes horribly wrong if you slow down the footage you can see that during the blast off the rocket slightly hits the ladder that Mike had used to climb into it which then snags one of the parachutes and this snag rips off this parachute and knocks the rocket off course and we don't have proof of what happened inside the rocket but it's theorized that this sudden jerk to the side knocks Mike unconscious which means that inside he's unable to pull any of the other Reserve parachutes and because of that Mad Mike and his rocket fall crashing to the ground and of course he doesn't make it 64-year-old mad mik Hugh was known as a homemade astronaut on a self- financed mission to space But as mola langi reports he died living out his dream", "duration(in seconds)": 522.0, "region": "US"}}

But, in 1975 and 1982, 4 of the Soviet Union’s Venera probes captured our only photos of Venus’ surface. The Venera landers scanned the surface back and forth to create panoramic images of their surroundings. They revealed yellow skies and cracked, desolate landscapes that were both alien and familiar, views of a world that may have once been like Earth before experiencing catastrophic climate change.

What does Venus look like, what does the surface of venus look like, Venera 14, Venera 13, Soviet space program, NASA, space, landing probe, Documentary, Venusian, spacecraft, Scorched planet, Have we seen the surface of Venus?", "script": "[Music] on march 5th 1982 the soviet union's venera 14 lander successfully touched down on the surface of our hellish neighbor venus in total it worked for just 57 minutes before succumbing to the harsh environment but in that short time it managed to capture a color panoramic photo of its scorched surroundings more than four decades later and this photo is still one of the best we have from the surface of venus venera was a series of space probes launched by the soviet union in the 1960s 70s and 80s on a mission to study the planet's bizarre environment but it also was a program aimed at returning the first ever close-up photos from the surface of another planet over the course of the program 13 probes successfully reached venus and transmitted data about our neighbor eight landed successfully on the surface and four managed to capture incredible photographs the reason it is so difficult to land on venus is that below that thick toxic cloud cover that is perpetually shrouding the planet the surface experiences extreme temperatures and pressures in fact venus is the hottest planet in the solar system even though mercury is closer to the sun here the temperatures reach about 475 degrees celsius which is about 900 degrees fahrenheit to put that into some kind of perspective that's more than seven times hotter than the highest ever recorded air temperature on earth hot enough to melt lead but that's just the temperature at the surface of venus all that thick cloud creates a crushing air pressure more than 90 times that of earth's here the atmosphere would be similar to the pressures found more than 914 meters or 3000 feet below the ocean along with the extreme heat this environment would easily destroy most spacecraft attempting to explore venus's horrifying landscape however the venera landers were designed to withstand these intense conditions for just about long enough to collect data and send us the first ever glimpse of the venusian surface but how exactly do you take a photograph in such a hellish environment what was clear based on previous data is that if the camera were placed outside of the protective shell then the enormous pressure and temperature would destroy it therefore engineers placed a telephoto meter inside the lander through a special porthole light from the surface bounced through a periscope which then directed it to the camera that was protected inside venera 9 which launched on june 8 1975 was the first mission to attempt to take photos of the venusian surface using this technology though the probe successfully landed unfortunately only one of the lens caps of the two cameras separated what was planned as a 360 degree panoramic photo around the lander became a 180 degree photograph but we did get our first ever look at this scorched landscape the white object at the bottom of the photo is part of the lander and the distortion is caused by the old venera imaging system angular and partly weathered rocks can be seen dominating the landscape many partly buried in soil and the mysterious horizon is visible in the upper left and right corners following venera 9's footsteps venera 10 reached to the surface on october 25th 1975. again unfortunately only one of the lens caps separated properly returning a 180 degree panoramic photo before going silent after about 65 minutes or so the lighting was similar to that on earth on an overcast summer day during the photograph according to scientists the objects at the bottom are parts of the spacecraft and the ground seems to be covered in flat slabs of rock similar to volcanic areas found here on earth in december 1978 venera 11 and venera 12 landed on venus collecting even more data for over an hour but also attempting to capture the first ever color images unfortunately in both cases the lens cap issue struck again on these two missions both lens caps on the cameras failed to separate so while the landers returned valuable data neither was able to take any photographs after this disappointing lens cap malfunction engineers made a series of changes to the design of venera 13 and venera 14 which as it stands are the only probes that have ever transmitted colour photos of the shrouded venusian landscape venera 13 landed on venus on march 1 1982. once on the surface the lens caps successfully ejected and the cameras began taking a panoramic photo around the lander the probe survived for 127 minutes before going silent which was enough time to capture in color what appears to be a bizarre landscape dominated by flat dark layered rocks and fine grain-like soil material filling the gaps the lens cap can be seen sitting in front of the lander and distant rolling ridges are visible in the corner of the photos just four days later on march 5th 1982 venera 14 successfully landed in a different region of venus and like its twin the lens cap also successfully ejected allowing us to see even more of this hellish terrain this time however the ground seems far more fractured with very little of the grain like soiled material seen in 13's images once again you can see the ejected lens cap and in the distance the hazy horizon each of these incredible photos gave us a tiny glimpse into a world covered in cloud so thick that its surface was a mystery up until the first lander arrived they revealed to us a yellow sky above a cracked desolate landscape that is both alien and familiar they found that venus is so harsh that no earth creature could ever survive there yet this world may have once been earth-like before it experienced catastrophic climate change it has been decades since we got a fresh look at what's below the clouds of our scorched neighbor but that might be about to change because this golden hot vision of hell is about to get a few more visitors one of the most exciting is nasa's da vinci plus mission which will study the origin evolution and present state of venus from near the top of the clouds all the way to the ground the mission has a planned launch date sometime in 2029 so we will have to wait a bit longer yet but during a flyby the davinci spacecraft will release a descent probe that will be carrying a camera allowing us to see venus like never before on its hour-long descent the probe will take thousands of measurements and capture close-up images of the surface as soon as it emerges from below the thick clouds the probe is not required to survive the landing however but if it does it could provide up to an additional 17 minutes of invaluable science unfortunately the da vinci plus descent probe does not have a panoramic camera meaning that the old photos from the venera landers may still be the best close-ups we have of our hellish neighbor for many years yet a testament to the brilliant engineering that went into these ground-breaking probes all those years ago i hope you enjoyed this video if you did tap the like button

video I'm going to talk about the rower's design explain how to perform basic rowing techniques as well as share some rowing workouts you can perform let's get started rowing is an excellent full body cardio workout that any Fitness level from beginner to advance can enjoy and if you're a beginner looking for cardio workouts I have a sixe cardio Kickstart program that includes 30 workouts for the treadmill rower elliptical bike and stair climber to build your confidence as well as endurance and you can get 10% off with the discount code cardio check it out in my description anyways there are many different types of rowers such as an air rower and a hydro rower but for the most part rowing machines are designed very similarly they typically have footrests a handle a movable seat that Glides along a rail a monitor and a way to adjust the resistance level the foot rests have an adjustable plate called a foot stretcher foot stretchers are designed to secure your feet with foot straps when you row before you start rowing the foot stretcher should be adjusted so that the widest part of your foot is covered by the strap once your feet are in pull the straps to ensure your feet are secure and locked in place and when you're done with the rower just loosen the straps to get your feet out the rower handle is where you'll grip to perform the rowing motion make sure to hold it with a firm but relaxed grip the seat is what allows you to Glide smoothly along the rail so make sure you're sitting comfortably the monitor displays workout metrics such as time meters traveled Strokes per minute time it takes to travel 500 M calories and Watts the higher Strokes per minute the higher the Watts and the less time it takes to travel 500 M all indicate an intense Row in which you're working hard and exerting a lot of effort and the lower your Strokes per minute the lower watts and the more time it takes to travel 500 M indicates an easier effort depending on the type of rower you're using there should be a dial or adjustment of some sort that allows you to change the resistance level with a higher resistance the harder and faster you row can lead to more distance travel per stroke however if you're just starting out I recommend using a low to Middle resistance level so you can focus on your rowing technique the basic rowing technique can be broken down into four phases the catch the Drive the finish and the recovery with the catch you want to sit at the front end of the rail close to the monitor with your knees bent shins vertical and arms extended making sure your core is engaged from here we'll enter the next phase which is the drive in this phase you'll push off with your legs and as your legs straighten Lean Back slightly and pull the handles towards your chest remember here that your leg is generating most of the power not your arms after your legs are fully extended you're in the Finish phase in which your back is slightly leaning and the handle is close to your lower chest and elbows out into the sides of your body finally we enter the recovery phase which will have you extending your arms back out hinging forward at the hips and bending your knees to return to the catch position preparing you for your next stroke and then repeat this process for the duration of your workout in this demonstration I've shown you how to perform a mid row where you pull the handle towards your lower chest which activates the midback and lats there's also a high row which targets your upper back and rear deltoids more here you're going to pull the handles towards your upper upper chest or collar bone area keeping your elbows high and out to the sides and squeezing your shoulder blades at the top a low row will activate more of your middle back and lats the drive here involves pulling the handle towards your abs and elbows close to your body at the top of this movement you're going to squeeze your back muscles another type of row is the reverse grip row which targets your biceps and upper back with this type of row you're going to hold the handle with an underhand grip keeping your elbows close to your body and squeezing your back and biceps at the top of the movement two common types of workouts on a rowing machine are steady state in and interval workouts in a steady state workout you're rowing at a consistent moderate intensity for a prolong period of time the goal is to maintain a steady pace and heart rate throughout the session an example of this workout could be rowing at a moderate pace for 30 minutes keeping your stroke rate and speed steady in an interval workout you're alternating between periods of high-intensity rowing and low intensity or a rest period the aim is to push the body to work at maximum effort during the high intensity intervals and recover during low intensity phases an example of this is rowing hard for 1 minute followed by 2 minutes of easy rowing or complete rest repeated for 20 minutes and if you're a beginner looking for more cardio workouts to follow check out the sixe program I mentioned earlier in my description so you going to give the row a try let me know in the

Next generation. Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it will be known as the F 47. The generals picked a title, and, it's a beautiful number. F 47. It's something, the likes of which nobody has seen before in terms of all of the attributes of a fighter jet. There's never been anything even close to it, from speed to maneuverability to what it can have to payload. And this is, been in the works for a long period of time. after a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the next generation air dominance platform. And to Boeing, as you know, was highly competitive for there was a lot of competition generals and, that's been going on for a long time, very, very tough competition. But this plane is has produced numbers that nobody's ever seen before. The air 47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. An experimental version of the plane is secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation. There's no other nation. We know every other plane I've seen every one of them, and it's not even close as a next level, you know, level five is good. This is level six. They say the air 47 is equipped with state of the art stealth technology. It's virtually unseeable and, unprecedented power. It's got the most power of any jet of its kind ever made. Maneuverability, likewise, is the, there's never been anything like it. Despite the power and speed. its speed is top. so over two, which is something that you don't hear very often. America's enemies will never see it coming. Hopefully we won't have to use it for that purpose, but you have to have it. And, if it ever happens, they won't know what the hell hit them. A new fleet of these magnificent planes will be built in the air and in the air. During my administration over the next couple of years. It's ready to go. They've already built much of what has to be built in terms of production, including the ships will ensure that the USA continues to dominate the skies. Well, we've given in order for a lot. We can't tell you the price because it would give it would give way to some of the technology and some of the size of the plane. Good size plane. This contract also represents a historic investment in our defense industrial base, helping to keep America at the cutting edge of aerospace and technology our allies are calling constantly. They want to buy them also and will certain allies will be selling them, perhaps toned down versions. We'd like to tone them down at about 10%, which probably makes sense, because someday, maybe they're not our allies, right? This is a big day. This is a big day for our United States Air Force as well. You know, air dominance is not a birthright, but it's become synonymous with American air power. Their dominance needs to be earned every single day. And since the earliest days of aerial warfare, the brave American airmen have jumped into their machines, taken to the air, and they've cleared the skies. And whether that be clearing the skies so we can rain down destruction on our enemies from above, we can clear the path, the ground forces below. That's been our commitment to the fight, and that's really been our promise to American. And with this at 47, as the crown jewel in the next generation air dominance family of systems, we're going to be able to keep that promise well into the future. I also want to thank everyone from industry and with the government, our engineers who have worked tirelessly on this program to bring it where we are right now. Today. This shows that American talent, American skill and American determination are second to none because this platform is second to none. So we believe that this provides more lethality, it provides more capability, more modernized capability in a way that is built to adapt this, along with our collaborative combat aircraft. The president talked about withdrawals. This is allowing us to look into the future and unlock the magic that is human machine teaming. And as we do that, we're going to right the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this. This enables us to do this. The manner in which we put this program together puts more control in the hands of the government, so we can update and adapt at the speed of relevance, at the speed of technology, not at the speed of bureaucracy. This is more Air force. This is more options for the president. We say, is our mission in the United States Air Force is to fly, fight and win air power anytime, anywhere. If you want to go anywhere, you have to have a platform that gets you anywhere. This provides the president of options from the very one end, which is a quick response, and then we can get right back into fighting stance without having to deploy troops that are going to take maybe months and cost more lives. We can be back in fighting stance, and may we restore that deterrence all the way to decisive victory as part of a joint force that is most lethal and capable of military ever known history. That's what we provide now, and this allows us to provide in the future. It's more deterrence, more capability. It's what peace to strength looks like into the future. Mr.. President. Trump announced that Boeing will build this F 47 fighter jet for the Air Force today. You were talking about down sizing. airplanes are always so expensive, aren't they? Boondoggle? Usually, $2 trillion program for the F-35. The F-22, 20 years of overruns and corruptions and mistakes. And yeah, they're great planes. But, you know, if you think about how wars are fought in the future, very expensive manned aircraft are just not the thing that you want to spend all your time and money on. it's kind of like having a missile shield to cover the entire continental United States. Sounds cool, but it's going to be a huge boondoggle that's going to take money away from the things that we need, really, which are cyber, in my opinion, drones, future technologies, I and so yeah, no, I think it's, it's just a huge, problem waiting to happen. But I don't know, maybe maybe you feel differently. Well, actually, you know, I think in part you're right. The one one thing, Josh, that I found interesting is that the f 47 is supposed to kind of be a quarterback, for a fleet of manned aircraft, plus drones. so this is kind of their collaborative combat aircraft concept. So in addition to the next generation air dominance aircraft, which they're not quite sure whether to categorize as a fighter or a bomber or both, they then have this collaborative combat aircraft system that they basically want to have an aircraft, a manned aircraft like a 47 going out there and then a fleet of drones that will then be directed, presumably, by the pilot in the F 47. Now, whether or not that actually happens, that is another, you know, another story doesn't sound expensive at all. Right. I heard the one version where the drones come out of the plane, like the plane has the drones, and then, I mean, I saw that one. Seems a little ambitious. It was a great move, you know? And the Chinese, they announced their a generation six fighter. That's why they're doing this. Because the Chinese leaked the information about their fighter. So Trump has to combat it. So I get that in a propaganda kind of versus propaganda kind of way. But I mean, let's have a think about this before we spend another $2 trillion on planes. Well, and the thing is, Boris and Brianna, the the idea here really should be to synchronize your war plans, your strategies with the money that you spend arguing. Ideally, with the types of technologies that you're, that you're actually going to put out there. And Josh is absolutely right. If the Chinese had what was about a month ago or so, they released videos of their six gen six generation aircraft flying around, very mysterious looking planes that, you know, kind of fit the mold of what a sixth generation aircraft should look like in terms of stealth capabilities and potential quarterback. I'll call them capabilities that, you would have in a situation like this. So these are these are exciting technologies. but they have to be managed properly. And this is where, you know, a Doge effort could potentially pay dividends. in a situation like this, you also have to wonder about Boeing itself, given some of the issues that the company has recently had, we have to leave the conversation there. The Colonel, Cedric Layton, Josh Rogan, appreciate you both. joining us. Thanks so much.", "duration(in seconds)": 534.0, "region": "US"}}

video I'll show you how I made this system monitoring feature for my utility app for the Mac I'll show you how it works and some lessons I learned while working on it because I had to make some interesting choices and trade-offs to make it work the way it does full disclaimer this feature is a paid feature of my app but I left some codes like this one throughout the video that you can use to claim your free copy so make sure to pay attention and catch them when they appear you see you got to stay alert otherwise this video doesn't have any sponsored Parts also one more thing I want to address because some people in the comments call me out on this all the time you see the reason I feel myself in coffee shops working is not because I want to sell you this lifestyle or whatnot I have nothing to gain from that I sure am not sponsored by Porsche but what's the reason then the truth is much more pedestrian I no longer have a home studio nor a desk setup for that matter it's my baby daughter's room now and I'm just a guy and this the coffee shop and occasional street photography I do is my little creative escap Cape something I do to find inspiration and if I can also find and capture a memorable moment from my city to share with you guys then even better okay now that we have that settled the next obvious question is why make a system monitoring feature for my app when Mac OS already has a perfectly working activity monitor I think that mostly depends on your definition of perfectly activity monitor is highly revered in the small Circles of people who find satisfaction in pointless waiting but even if we turn a blind eye to this short delay I wouldn't describe the user experience as anything more than whelming so to help with the narrative progression of this video the question I should ask you is obviously how can we do better than this but a question I want to ask is why is Swift such a garbage language and why are Apple Engineers who made it still allowed near a computer and to risk spoiling the rest of the video both questions will be answered the challenge with making a system monitoring app of any sort is that capturing a snapshot of system usage cannot exactly be described as free within most reasonable definitions of free I typically have a few safari windows open a code editor and maybe notes or notion and I easily see over 600 processes running at any time that's about 590 processes more than I would like to see and certainly enough to call cause all sorts of performance problems I would most definitely like to skip Al together so after looking at what these 600 processes really are it turns out most are system level drivers controllers data collectors and key loggers you know just the usual but there's just not much you can do about it so I decided to cut a corner here and only record and display the ones that take up any notable system resources at all the way I determine this is by taking the top 10 system processes by CPU usage then separately by memory and network and I take the union of those three sets which results in about 20 something processes even worth recording the rest of the processes are regular apps and they're numerous helpers but here's a question do you believe chat GPT has a sense of humor listen to this when I started work on this feature I asked GPT to write me some code to generate fake system usage data every second so I can iterate on the UI and it did that it added most commonly found apps to some list and randomized the numbers fair enough but it was a little bit too random the usage wasn't very realistic so I asked it to make it more believable and in made a few adjustments most notably it made Chrome use all the ram gave me a little bit of a haha so with the rest of the processes I decided to group them under their logical parent and show the aggregate usage next to each process because saying that cursor uses 100 megab of RAM is just recreational gaslighting on a typical day it's much closer to 100 kg of RAM and so I ended up with these neatly organized groups of processes that I collect over time and from which I draw the chart above with the darker color being the system usage and the lighter being users's own usage the chart allows you to select any previous snapshot and investigate past sources of mild to moderate frustration caused by excessive and unjustified usage of your CPU memory and Network and you can dive deeper and look at any process in isolation to monitor how it's trending which might be interesting for developers Like Yours Truly or if you're just fed up completely you can end it and in the next update I will try to include the phone number of the person who wrote this piece of crap along with the rest of the process information right here to offer more direct means of retaliation some of my friends ask me how I come up with scripts for these YouTube videos or how to improve writing one of the tricks you can use to make your writing stand up out is to combine words or phrases that logically don't go together for example if you take the word swift you can combine it with intuitive or productive to achieve great comedic effect I started working with swift some three years ago and in the first 2.97 years I remained convinced that skill issues were the main reason I preferred filing taxes to opening up xcode in mind you Norwegian tax law is not one of my strong suits but the last time I filed my tax says it dawned on me the government website just crashes less often but it's not just the crashes it's also about how you do certain things in Swift UI well never mind so I decided to implement this feature using a web view the web for all its flaws offers a better developer experience than what Apple was able to bring forth using its own framework written in its own language running on its own Hardware truly fascinating I chose to use SW because it is simple and intuitive in many of the same ways that Swift UI wasn't I quite like SW but not for the reason that most people do definitely not the clever compiler architecture or the benchmarking performance that most front-end developers who work in react read about only in incognito mode I like it because of the way Transitions and animations are built into the framework s gives you the tools to Delight the user whereas other Frameworks give you the tools to Delight your manager with ever increasing levels of code complexity each has advantages what makes a great architecture this is a trick question it's funny how if I were on an interview I would be expected to give a comprehensive well-rounded emotionally moving intelligently composed answer that evokes the feelings of longing for simpler times while acknowledging that client side apps still provide better user experience whereas in fact the most correct thing to say is it depends that don't get you the job though the mistake I made when I started writing this feature is I approached it by creating the architecture first I Envision dashboards with widgets and interactions between them fully customizable of course declaratively configured in Json of course but I failed to Envision I'd have to make Json T in complete in the process to make it work so after about 5 days of mucking about with this I finally resigned because it felt a little bit like inventing a new language to describe a thing you haven't seen yet so this first dashboard is cod entirely bespoke with some very light abstractions like this bar chart component and this data loading Helper and I also made this communication bridge between Swift and web kind of reusable for future features but since I don't have a manager to impress with code complexity I will be rolling out this simpler version in the next couple days gradually to all users so make sure to download one menu and check it out and thanks for watching don't", "duration(in seconds)": 511.0, "region": "US"}}

Pro meanwhile deeps 10cent and quen All released Banger Chinese models but nobody's talking about it instead every eyeball in the tech world right now is hypnotized by open ai's brand new GPT 40 image generator which has transformed the internet into a gbi anime cartoon nightmare this is exactly the AI dystopia that Senpai Miyazaki creator of the GBL Animation Studio tried to warn us about years ago when he said quote I am utterly disgusted if you really want to make creepy stuff you can go ahead and do it I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself that was years ago but now this nightmare is in full effect if you make the mistake of going on Twitter today you'll find that all your favorite memes have been ruined by GPT 40 in today's video we'll take a closer look at open ai's latest toy along with a few other awesome tools that just put us one step closer to the singularity it is March 28th 2025 and you're watching the code report when I read the newspaper that GPT 40 added an image generator my expectations were extremely low especially after the disappointments of Sora and GPT 4.5 low expect however open AI just went out and totally redeemed Itself by shipping some actual fire this tool has allowed me to throw graphic design software like canva in the garbage because now I can create infographics and marketing material with near perfect text rendering it even produced an almost Good comic strip for me and it can even handle transparency like players unlike most other image generators but everybody's talking about its ability to transform images into specific art styles that's pretty cool but the significant thing here is that it gives us the ability to render our AI girlfriends in ways that were previously Impossible by maintaining character continuity like now I can upgrade her with new poses new outfits or even add her to photos of those lonely family dinners that's impressive but how does it work this is closed AI we're talking about so there's no paper or code to look at but apparently they use an auto regressive approach instead of diffusion a diffusion algorithm in models like stable diffusion and mid Journey generate an entire image all at once but GPT 4 takes a different approach generating the image pixel by pixel from left to right top to bottom it almost doesn't even look artificial but it actually contains a controversial Watermark provided by the Coalition for Content Providence and authenticity in fact if you take this image and upload it to the ctpa tool you can see it was generated by open AI along with a history of any modifications to it a camera manufacturers and software developers like Adobe are implementing this into their soft Ware with the goal of tracking every change that happens to a digital asset like an image and that of course is to keep you safe from misinformation at the expense of your privacy and freedom and platforms like YouTube and steam are now requiring people to disclose that they use AI Assets in their work and that brings up a big philosophical question that was first posed by someone with an anime profile picture on the internet with slops razor you ask can you tell it's AI generated by looking at it if the answer is no then it's indistinguishable from Human work thus no disclosure is needed but if you answer yes then it's visibly slop and again no AI disclosure is needed c2p is just deep State bloatware but I digress if you're poor the other thing you need to know about is Gemini 2.5 Pro this new state-of-the-art model from Google actually slaps not only is it arguably just as good for programming as Claude 3.7 with a bigger context window but it's also better than reasoning

amphibious assault ship then came the breaking news videos of two UFO like stealth fighter jets flooded the internet it appears to be the maiden flight of two new sixth generation stealth fighter [Music] [Music] aircraft that was the flight of a Chinese stealth fighter flying ahead of its j20 wingman the video is believed to be from an Airfield that's operated by the changdu aircraft Industry Group it's one of the two major corporations that makes military aircraft for China the changu based manufacturer is responsible for making two of China's major fighter jets there's the fourth generation J10 vigorous dragon and the fifth generation j20 Mighty Dragon stealth fighter but this time changu has revealed a new aircraft it's being called the j36 because the aircraft that was spotted had the numbers 36011 painted on it it's reportedly the world's first sixth generation fighter jet while details about the new fighter remain classified a breakdown of the videos and photos reveals some intriguing details the most striking feature is that the new aircraft has a large diamondlike delta wing and a completely tailless configuration a tailless aircraft has a smaller radar signature enhancing its stealth capabilities it also has less drag improving supersonic cruise but it affects overall stability and maneuverability the j36 appears much larger than the j20 which means it can perform long range operations while carrying a bigger payload and the aircraft's most unusual feature is its triple air intake Arrangement there's an air intake on top of the Jet and twin intakes on either side of the fuselage in the belly of the body this means the aircraft could have three engines there's currently no fighter jet in the world that has three engines considering the new Chinese Jet's large size the third engine may be necessary for operations at high altitudes and longrange high-speed flights but the j36 wasn't the only aircraft that made headlines because 2,500 km away Beijing had another war machine up its sleeve while the j36 was conducting initial flight tests in the central Chinese city of changdu another possible sixth generation aircraft took flight in Northeast China in the city of Shenyang home of China's second major aircraft maker the Shenyang aircraft Corporation Shenyang makes aircraft like the j11 and j16 which are copies of Russia's suo 30 and 27 Jets Shenyang also makes China's second stealth jet the j35a which was recently revealed at the jwai air show in November videos and photos revealed that the Shenyang aircraft Corporation has also reportedly unveiled a sixth generation fighter jet the second Sixth Gen jet was seen flying with a j16 as its wingman while the changu design has a Delta Wing the one seen flying over Shenyang has a swept Wing like configuration it's conventionally known as a Lambda Wing the aircraft can be seen with just two engines and is almost the same size as the j16 it was flying next to however like the changdu this jet also has a tailless configuration the aircraft has an angular and diamondlike shape which could allow the jet to have low observability China has now unveiled two prototypes for its sixth generation fighter it's the first country in the world to do so the United States France Germany and the UK only have such designs on paper however Beijing has been deliberate with these unveilings because Shan ping is going for Maximum Impact military experts believe that whoever gets the sixth generation fighter first will dominate the airspace battle these are more advanced than the fifth generation jets in terms of stealth super Cruise dog fighting abilities Beyond visual range operations cyber and Space Warfare capabilities and advanced Weaponry including energy weapons like lasers there's no clear timeline for China's intentions however Beijing reportedly plans to induct its two six generation aircraft variants into full service by 2032 while the two jets are still away from combat roles China commissioned an amphibious assault ship on Ma's birthday as well it's named the Sichuan the ship is capable of launching fighter jets it's equipped with an electromagnetic

learning time is precious right you want to learn to code as fast as possible well by learning how to learn you can tailor your coding education to be more effective where instead of taking 5 hours learning a concept you'd only need to spend an hour here's some examples to give you an idea you can use diagrams to plan a simple coding project then jump in and start building it and finally ask people for tips on how to improve it the key is to discover what works best for you and use it to make your learning as smooth and enjoyable as possible remember there's no one size fits-all in learning especially in something as diverse as coding while I can't directly help you find your unique learning style I can definitely guide you with General tips throughout the video to speed up your progress in coding and now for the big question where do I start coding is a vast jungle but don't worry I'll give you a map to guide you on the right path but I need to know a few things from you first what do you want to make why do you want to code do you want a big Tech job do you have an app idea want to make a video game okay that might have been too fast let's slow it down and start with two questions what do you want to make your answer to this question will guide your learning path to make sure you're not learning something you're not supposed to and end up wasting time it'll decide the resources you choose and the projects you'll embark on remember there's no right or wrong answer here it's all about what excites you and what keeps you up at night thinking I can't wait to create that now for the second question why do you want to code are you looking for a career in programming do you want to bring a unique app idea to life or are you just coding for fun this is what's going to motivate you when you eventually hit that bug at 2 a.m. and can't figure out why your code isn't working understanding your why also helps in choosing the right resources if you're career Focus you might lean towards areas that are easier to get a job in if it's a hobby you have more freedom to explore certain areas now that we've got your what and why let's talk about the how three what programming language should I learn the programming language you should learn all depends on your answer for those two questions there's no such thing as a best language but there does exist popular languages Let Me Explain what what you should research based on your interest if you want to build websites or web applications start with HTML CSS and JavaScript these are the main Technologies of the web HTML structures your content CSS Styles it and JavaScript adds interactivity as you advance consider learning Frameworks like react view spel or angular for more Dynamic and responsive applications from there you can start learning some back end if you want to build mobile apps your path depends on the platform for iOS apps learn Swift it's Apple modern programming language for iOS for Android start with Java or cotlin cotlin is the newer language and it offers more modern features and is now preferred by Google for Android development if you'd like to do both consider learning react native or flutter for those of you who want to build video games check out some video game engines like unity gdau and Unreal Engine unity and gdau uses C and gdau has its own language while Unreal Engine primarily uses C++ and for those of you who want to take over the world with AI and machine learning python is your starting point this area is not just about coding be prepared to learn a lot about math especially statistics calculus and algebra python is the most common language in this field for its Simplicity and the powerful libraries like tensorflow pytorch psychic learn and a lot of other libraries that support machine learning operations in each of these paths your foundation is crucial once you grasp the basics you can delve into more complex projects and refine your skills in your chosen area of Interest there's a lot more areas when it comes to coding so I strongly suggest you check out this video here if you want a highlevel road map of every main area of programming to get you started now that you have an idea of what programming language to learn we can move on four how to start learning to code so far we've discussed picking the right programming language and understanding your why but what about the actual learning process you know how to code first off let's talk about resources there's a wealth of information out there from online courses YouTube videos books tutorials and coding communities there's websites like code academy free code cam the Odin project and corsera they offer for structure courses that are great for beginners YouTube definitely has its fair share of tutorials but also don't overlook the power of books they often go deeper into Concepts than many online resources however there's a common Pitfall that almost every beginner gets stuck in that you should watch out for tutorial help a cycle of constantly consuming programming tutorials without being able to apply the knowledge in the real world and build real apps tutorial hell is one of the worst things to ever get stuck in you feel like you're not growing or improving where if you stay there you'll want to quit because you feel like this is not for you I was stuck at tutorial hell at one point and it was one of the worst feelings ever I really wanted to quit programming because I felt like this was not for me at all I kept watching tutorial after tutorial and I just felt like I never got better for some reason it's easy to get stuck in a loop of constantly watching tutorials and courses Without Really applying what you've learned while these resources build your foundation they don't always push you to the next level of solving real world world problems this is where the learning resources you pick make all the difference if you do prefer tutorials one of the best resources out there is today sponsored brilliant brilliant sets the standard for Interactive Learning for computer science data science and math brilliant stands out from other learning resources because it focuses on active problem solving and Interactive Learning which will help you get out of tutorial hell since learning is not about watching and repeating it's about challenging yourself and Brilliant does exactly that by customizing the content to your skill level to make sure you're learning at a comfortable Pace they offer thousands of lessons from basic topics such as loops and conditionals to Advanced topics like Ai and neural networks you'll never get bored since new lessons are added every month one of my favorite courses that they recently added is how llms work where you get to learn how something like chat GPT Works they explore topics like how do they predict the next word and how they're so creative and the best thing about it is I learn and remember the concepts better because of how interactive it is so if you'd like to try everything brilliant has to offer for free for 30 days visit brilliant.org slthe coding slw or click the link in the description the the first 200 of you who sign up will get 20% off brilliant's annual premium subscription you're welcome enjoy it now if you prefer something other than tutorials then the key to breaking out of tutorial hell is to start practicing Project based learning this means applying what you've learned to real world projects you can still watch or read tutorials like making a to-do list app but the key difference is to add on to the tutorial and build other features from scratch this way you're not just following instructions you're innovating and building your skills in a practical Hands-On manner for example let's say you're watching a tutorial on making a calculator program they show you how to add two numbers well you can add on to the tutorial by adding a feature of subtracting two numbers it wasn't in it but you did it from scratch and now you're learning even better start with small projects maybe you want to build a personal website or you know the simple calculator and as you work on these projects you'll encounter real problems and learn to solve them which is a critical skill in coding not only does this reinforce your learning but it also starts building your portfolio which is essential if you're looking to pursue a career in coding remember the goal isn't to get it perfect the first time it's all about learning iterating and improving each project you build will boost your confidence and understanding of coding and let me give you a quick cheat code you can speed this up even more by having a coding buddy or sharing your progress online let people see what you're building let them make fun of it let them improve it in the end you're going to be learning a lot on what not to do and what to do better I truly believe if I was sharing my progress online sooner I would be so much better I would probably be 100 times better than I am today you can join my Discord if you want to share your work I'd love to see what you're creating I just enjoy programming and that's everything that I have for you and I hope I gave you enough information to start coding so have fun build what you want and I can't wait to see what you build so I'll see you in the next video and uh have fun", "duration(in seconds)": 581.0, "region": "US"}}

"[Music] [Music] iido is quite effective in incap initating Street Bullies and arrogant individuals however in this video we will see how effective iido is when facing a professional MMA [Music] fighter some techniques in iido are known to be very painful however in MMA fights Fighters hands are wrapped and taped despite this Fighters like Anderson Silva have trained in iido and have tried to incorporate its techniques into fights within the [Music] Octagon the following fighter also demonstrated that gloves are not an obstacle to performing iido locking techniques he managed to make his opponent Fall using a perfectly executed wrist lock technique not just once this iido practitioner was able to make his opponent fall repeatedly and dominate the fight with his lethal iido techniques but once there [Music] was this is an example of how iido can be effectively used in an MMA fight iido itself is a Japanese martial art developed in the early 20th century by Mor WBA aido focuses on harmonizing with the opponent's energy rather than confronting it [Music] directly iido techniques involve circular movements that redirect the opponent's Force using their momentum against them iido practitioners usually avoid direct confrontation preferring to panel attacks into controlled [Music] movements come on man please put the gun away iido techniques emphasize efficiency utilizing minimal physical strength by applying joint locks throws and precise Stripes combat in Aikido often involves manipulating the attacker's joints such as the wrists elbows or shoulders to incapacitate or unbalance bance them to defend practitioners frequently deflect attacks by blending with incoming force and redirecting it through circular movements this technique focuses on disrupting the opponent's balance making them vulnerable to being [Music] subdued overall all aikido's philosophy of blending circular movements and minimal Force sets it apart as a martial art centered on Harmony and effective [Music] self-defense iido techniques can also be adapted to various fighting situations making them versatile for different types of opponents and arenas for instance in a match between a one-handed iido master and a professional MMA fighter the iido master managed to challenge the MMA fighter significantly even with just one hand the Aikido master was able to hold his own when they engaged in a clinch he even managed to take the MMA fighter to the ground not stopping there the Aikido Master continue to dominate even during ground combat y next there was an arrogant IO practitioner who claimed that his martial art was Superior to Brazilian jiu-jitsu he then challenged an MMA fighter with a BJJ background to a match however what happened in the arena was completely opposite to his big talk throughout the fight he only tried to evade the power powerful attacks of the MMA fighter and never once launched an attack the MMA fighter taught him a valuable lesson with a hard slam to the floor that left him in significant [Music] pain continuing with the story of an MMA fighter with a BJJ background versus an iido practitioner this time the MMA fighter had a larger and more muscular physique [Music] they were engaged in a clinch position for a long time before the MMA fighter finally managed to take down the iido master with his immense [Music] strength however this did not have a significant impact on the iido master while under pressure in the ground fight he executed a neck lock that forced the MMA fighter to [Music] submit let's move to an outdoor Arena where two overweight Fighters are competing the iido fighter wearing white pants was much older than the MMA fighter this was evident in their fight where the MMA fighter dominated with his powerful punches the MMA fighter took only 30 seconds to win the fight by forcing the iido master to the ground lastly there was a Japanese iido fighter facing an intimidating looking MMA fighter wait however the MMA fighter's intimidating appearance did not match his fighting abilities from the start of the match the MMA fighter was pressured to the edge of the Ring he could not break free from the tight hold of the iido master eventually he was thrown onto the canvas and they engaged in ground combat the iido practitioner did not give him any chance the MMA fighter ultimately submitted after being unable to withstand the extremely painful Aikido [Music] lck iido practitioners and enthusiasts around the world owe a great deal of gratitude and respect to Steven seagull as he is one of the individuals who popularized this Japanese martial art [Music] seagull's first job was as a dishwasher at a restaurant called The Wagon Wheel noticing his quick movements a Japanese Shotokan karate expert who was the cook at the restaurant decided to give him basic karate training this marked the beginning of seagull's long martial arts journey in 1964 he began studying Aikido under the guidance of Harry Koshi ishisaka each and in his late teens seagull moved to Japan with his father who was visiting the country for military reasons and they decided to stay there permanently not long after seagull earned a 7th degree black belt and the title of Shihan in iido this Japanese term is used in various martial arts to honor senior martial arts practitioners subsequently seagull became the first Foreigner in Japan to successfully run an iido dojo [Applause]", "duration(in seconds)": 556.0, "region": "US"}}

building wealth, making money, learning to invest, how to invest, shares, share market, share portfolio", "script": "today we're diving into a question I guarantee every new investor has asked themselves at some point should I invest in an ETF or should I pick individual stocks first and trust me this question isn't as simple as some people on YouTube or other platforms make it sound whether you're starting with $100 $10,000 or more this decision can shape the way you build your wealth for the long run by the end of this video hopefully you'll know some of the pros cons and risks of both ETFs and individual stocks and be able to make a more educated decision to see which one suits your personal investing goals better overall we'll start with stocks let's begin with what exactly is a stock a stock represents ownership in a specific company when you buy a share you own a small piece of that company if the business performs well the stock price potentially rises and you benefit from the capital growth you might also get dividends which are small payouts from the company's profits for example if you had invested in Amazon 10 years ago your money would have multiplied many times over but if you picked a struggling company like Kodak or Blockbusters you might have lost everything so stocks are high risk and highreward investments why do people love stocks they do have huge potential for growth especially if you choose the right companies early some companies pay consistent dividends creating a passive income and you might feel a personal connection to the business you believe in what are the downsides stocks are exposed to company specific risks one earnings miss a bad CEO decision or a global event can crash a stock price emotional decisions often lead people to sell at the worst possible moments so that's a bit more about stocks now we can hopefully understand ETFs an ETF stands for an exchangeraded fund think of an ETF like a giant basket of stocks instead of buying one individual company you buy into an fund that holds dozens or even thousands of companies for example an ETF in my portfolio is VGS which gives you access to over 1,500 global companies including the likes of Apple Microsoft Johnson and Johnson and so on you can also get country specific ones such as VO which is another one I hold which tracks the S&P 500 or even VAS which tracks the top 300 Australian companies so why do beginners love ETFs they offer instant diversification much lower risks compared to picking individual stocks and less emotional stress you don't have to worry about every piece of news affecting your entire portfolio etfs also have downsides you potentially won't be getting rich overnight etfs usually track the market's steady growth you might also pay small management fees have a look into this to make sure the ETF you're investing in is worth it for you if you like the idea of being hands-on and actively selecting companies ETFs for some investors can feel a bit boring we can also look at the risk verse reward the real world comparison so let's say you have $10,000 to invest today scenario A you put it all into one stock such as a popular one like Amazon or Tesla if the stock soarses 30% your 10,000 turns into 13,000 in just a few months awesome but if the stock crashes 30% your 10,000 turns into 7,000 and you feel every bit of that loss scenario B is you put the 10,000 into an ETF here the risk is spread across hundreds or thousands of companies if one or two underperform it might barely dent your portfolio and historically markets tend to recover over time so some of the key takeaways are if you're earlier investing journey reducing emotional stress and risk with an ETF can potentially help you stay invested long enough to succeed chasing individual stock winners can be exciting but this requires a thick skin and lots of research there's also an emotional side to investing one thing not often talked about enough is the emotional roller coaster that comes with investing in the stock market when you invest in an individual stock the ups and downs can be intense a stock you believe in could drop 20% in a single week even if the business is still strong and that can make an experienced investor second guess themselves etfs tend to smooth out this ride because you're automatically diversified even during big events like co the inflation scares recently and tech pullbacks etfs usually recover more predictably than compared to individual stocks and that matters because the real secret to building wealth isn't timing the market as you've probably heard it's time in the market so next is my real world approach i'll be honest I used both strategies when I first started I was picking individual stocks such as Apple my first ever investment but I did also diversify like I mentioned into VO and now my portfolio equates to ETFs around sitting at around 70% of the total portfolio value but I still hold individual stocks which I quite enjoy because it gives me the broad market tracking diversification and I still get the joy of picking stocks that I'm aligned with and I believe in long-term overall it's taught me the approach of staying tough and investing during times we're down such as 2022 when I taught myself some really good lessons of going through when my stock portfolio was down over 20% and continuously investing which allowed for the growth in 23 and 24 it's important to learn these lessons especially if you're going to be investing long-term in the stock market so what is the answer if you're just starting out you can potentially look at focusing on ETFs first and building stable foundations and growing from there or if you want more control you can pick individual stocks that you believe in but make sure you do your research on both the ETF you want to invest in and the individual stock both will allow you to gain experience in the market and hopefully some confidence and learn some good long-term lessons the most important thing many people say is to start the longer you wait potentially the harder it is to catch up and I'd love to hear from you if you are an ETF investor a stock picker or if you like a mix of both feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments and if you found this video helpful please give it a thumbs up and share how your stock portfolio is doing i also share weekly updates on mine on this channel which you can feel free to check out thank you", "duration(in seconds)": 470.0, "region": "US"}}

bring her down to the ground relentless [Music] assassin Exchange this might turn into a brawl it's great to have two foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] gotta wonder how long it's going to be until we're back into the clinch oh nice movement about Christmas coming in trying to cut those angles of Cheyenne [Applause] the boy Jack just comes forward yeah she's tough you know how did she offended that arm bar in the first round she just tucked it out near the one back and down [Music] Vortex certainly has the best in terms of the hexagon control she's backing up sharing quite alive [Applause] rushes it off again actually both hands he seems like she's quite the handiest person how long do these ladies take this punishment one after another and the entertainment is taking some damage as well but you can see it all over the face of Elizabeth yes for good measure tried to go over the takedown but it wasn't happening at all voy check was too fast enough Pete a good ride from Boychuk Christmas needs to be better knock it up a notch she was having success in the beginning of this round she needs to return to that voice text saying come on bring It action between these two clearance adjustments starting to get the momentum back on her side you can tell the confidence is there in this round much more than I'd round number two well I think I think the uh it's the fence we go as they were jockeying in for a position in reversion [Applause] against the fence and she's near her own corner so she's getting instructions as we speak trying to just get her left leg behind the right leg of the person starts and she can look for the practice with some more concerns and like using the weather she's got on the left-hand sideways Jake going into side control s [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and Christmas has quite a few words to say to her down she gave her a thumbs up though I I think all's good I think can't you can't learn respect after that yeah I mean that was that was fantastic well that was something special I don't know how they're gonna judge this so that any information that were razor close fight from beginning to end but I will go to you is analyze who you think won the fight I think this missed the guy won the fight just by then again which I got the heck I don't control the loaded the three rounds she was back in China quite a lot I think more significant Strong's got a Christmas Even though she's more blooded I'll go to the pool that's possible you could be onto something who would cause the most difficulty for Kara Banker I don't know that's a really good question because Danko is something special absolutely superb for a back and forth wall I mean it was it was one strike for another I mean they were literally strikes back and forth so it's it's a really really tough call and especially with the takedown at the end for motion yeah no indeed and it's it's just the future of the women's MMA in the Africans I love the division but both of these ladies in it regardless got some great matches from going forward from this if we don't get a rematch straight away from this because they both deserve the win they both keep everything ahead and the crowd were going absolutely Wild on some of those exchanges can be very interesting to see how this decision is a tough one to score for the judges as always it's going to be a contentious one both athletes in my mind for your winner by Split Decision fighting out of the blue Corner Cheyenne the Warrior Princess [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm here with your winner sugar and the Warrior Princess Christmas son you're very emotional such a tough fight you wanted this fight what are the thoughts and motions going through your mind right now everything like everything I've been through the past eight weeks being here you know my boyfriend the champion for you guys JP base if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be in this cage because the support goes a long way my team back in Vegas at home I love you guys but this is my home now and I hope I impressed all you South African fans tonight so thank you everybody it was a superb performance and we're so happy to see you in the hexagon we can't wait to see you fight again congratulations your winner ladies and gentlemen Cheyenne a Warrior Princess Christmas that was a special flight that was a good one and indeed the word around the campfire is that whoever won that fight is gonna fight giara banko and we'll see if that comes to fruition giant ballismus getting it done in dramatic fashion big big shout

finance books that   have had the biggest impact to my life over the \nlast few years and have completely changed my   mindset when it comes to money and time I'll share \na key takeaway from each of these so you have   a little preview of what you're getting yourself \ninto number one I will teach you the whole premise   of this book is that it's not about the money you \nmake it's about the money you keep and what you do   with that money that will really make a difference \nyou could be earning 70 80 grand a year but if you   don't know how to manage your money you will \njust be living paycheck to paycheck one of the   things I find most frustrating when I hear people \nfrom Finance backgrounds speak to people from   non-finance backgrounds is their inability to use \nsimple words when explaining something Sethi gets   this bang on he uses the terms that are very \nunderstandable to the everyday Layman from all   walks of life the device is pretty unconventional \nhe says buy all the lattes you want use credit   cards to your advantage and don't think about the \npennies but Focus instead on the big ticket items   the chapters have very clear actions on things \nyou could do like where you can open up your bank   accounts how to get out of debt as well as things \nlike how to bucket your money between fixed costs   between savings between investing and guilt-free \nspending if you're looking for a very practical   and actionable book he's your man next up we have \nthe four hour work week this book has been very   pivotal to my life if you have an interest in \nentrepreneurship or in business in the slightest   sense you really have to read this book ever \nsince I've got this book I've kind of formed a   very clear picture on exactly what I'm aiming for \nand also how I'm going to get there and it's the   kind of book I do wish I read like 10 years ago \nI would have done many things differently this   book has inspired me to think out the box and \nquestion everything I know about productivity   about time and about money most of us follow the \nsame routine where we go to school we graduate we   get a great job we work super hard and make loads \nof money and then eventually retire but this book   questions that whole system why should we be \nworking until we're 65 70 when we can't even   enjoy that money will have the ability to enjoy \nthat money as much but instead take those 20 30   years after retirement and spread them throughout \nour life instead he calls us mini retirements he   also alludes to this concept of the new Rich \nwhich is when you have total control of when   you work and where you work from and he explains \nhow the new Rich generally have Auto automated   streams of passive income that allow them to \nwork as much as they want or as little as they   want from anywhere they want to work from and in \nthis book he includes a lot of practical steps for   creating passive income streams that allow you to \nlive the new Rich lifestyle he also gives tips to   office employees on how they can live the new Rich \nlifestyle while still keeping their corporate job   I received a few comments on the back of another \nvideo that I made as to how I balance the side   hustles whilst working a full-time job in banking \nand a big reason why is down to the learnings   of this book it has so many tips and tricks on \nbeing efficient things like Outsourcing to remote   workers automated things batching different tasks \nso you could churn out things churn out more stuff   and the reason why I've been able to play around \nwith so many ideas without burning out is because   I've taken on so many of the ideas that Tim \nFerriss talks about in this book next up we have   Rich Dad Poor Dad I know you've probably heard \nof this one time and time again but it is the   number one top selling personal finance Book for a \nreason and I've put this one in because it really   was a Tipping Point for me from having an employee \nmindset and thinking about purely income to having   a business mindset and thinking about generating \nand Building Wealth and the storyline is that   there are two dads Robert has a rich dad and a \nPoor Dad and they have very different mindsets   in the book Robert explores the mindset that these \ntwo dads had when it came to money the dad who had   impeccable grades qualifications on qualifications \na high-paying job but was living paycheck to   paycheck was a poor dad and the rich dad who came \nfrom a completely different background and had a   completely different mindset when it came to money \nthe way he spoke about it the way he treated it   the way he used it and the way he made more money \nfrom it and in this book you take on the Journey   of these two individuals and their mindset when \nit comes to finances and wealth building and by   the end of the book it's so clear as to what \nmakes one of them rich and the other one poor   school doesn't teach us the things that I read in \nthis book while you shouldn't just stop at your   day job the tax implications of an entrepreneur \nversus an employee financial literacy as a whole   and the most important takeaway from this book \nis the way he describes asset and liabilities   the wealthy the buy assets whereas the poor and \nthe middle class by liabilities liabilities cost   money to buy and they cost money to maintain \nwhereas on the other hand every dollar you   invest into an asset becomes an employee that is \nworking for you when you're not working the goal   is to get your income as high above your expenses \nas possible so that you can invest the disposable   income you can invest the difference into assets \nwhich create more income and then there's this   beautiful cycle of increasing cash flow increasing \nassets increasing cash flow increasing assets next   up we have the cash flow quadrant this is kind \nof like a sequel to Rich Dad report ad but it's   a bit more sophisticated and in this book Robert \ngoes through the key steps that him and his wife   took to go from being homeless to Building Wealth \nand retiring young in this book Robert draws into   the four sections or the quadrants of different \nways we can earn money and he categorizes that   into four ways employees self-employed business \nand investors most of us are conditioned to become   employees or self-employed and that's the way \nthe system has been created we don't have lessons   on business us or in finance not at school at \nleast I didn't and no one learns how to become   an entrepreneur or how to invest their money but \nRobert says that true wealth come from BB and the   eye segment because of the freedom it gives you \nand it's all about building passive income so   since I've graduated I've always had a foot in the \ne-contrant I'm trying more and more to explore the   other quadrants and if I look at the people around \nme and those that have kind of made it in terms of   freedom and passive income are those in the B and \nthe I cash flow quadrants so this book is about   being intentional with which quadrant you want \nto be in and just because you're in one now it   doesn't mean that you can't make that shift and \nalso doesn't mean that you can't make that shift   overnight it just means using your time and money \nwisely so you can cross over to another quadrant   if that's what you want to do and this book gives \nyou all the skills and the mindset shifts that you   need to make to make that switch next up we have \nThink and Grow Rich there's a lot of controversy   around this book and that's a bit kind of fluffy a \nbit Airy fairy and kind of like the secret The Law   of Attraction but I personally am a huge believer \nin what the mind can believe if the mind can't   achieve with the right actions of course to back \nthat and I feel like the first step in getting   anywhere is to have this kind of outrageous level \nof self-belief that you can do anything and over   the course of 20 years the author Napoleon Hill \ninterviewed a bunch of people that had built huge   fortunes from scratch and he found common things \namongst all of them and he basically outlines in   this book the blueprint for how anyone can \nbecome rich this book makes you realize that   it doesn't take money to make money necessarily \nit does take the right mindset and he says that   getting rich requires three key things number \none desire number two a plan and number three   an unwavering focus and these three things will \nunleash the opportunities you need to make money   people think that it's all the latest things the \nlatest gadgets the most revolutionary ideas you   have to do but it really comes down to these three \nTimeless principles that stand the test of time   it might be a bit fluffy for some people but money \nand wealth really is about the mindset and less in   my opinion about knowing the complicated Financial \nthings and the financial actions that you need   to do this book rewire is your brain and makes \nyou think completely differently about finances   in a way that makes the whole making money and \nmanaging your money is so interesting next up we   have lean in by Cheryl Sandberg the books I've \nmentioned so far are about managing your money   making money grow for you in a way where you can \nsecure Independence and secure Financial abundance   managing your money is one part of it but to \nreally Propel and speed up that process you've   got to manage your money manage your expenses but \nalso increase your income increase your revenue   and for a lot of people watching this I imagine \nour day job is a huge source of that income it's   the foundation that's why the next book I want \nto recommend is Lena by Cheryl Sandberg a lot of   what we see and hear about today is about owning \na business about being an entrepreneur or whatever   but the reality is a lot of us do work in day jobs \nand so we need to know how to make the most out of   our situation and make sure we are getting the \npay we deserve and the money we deserve for the   work that we're putting in this book provides a \nlot of advice on how to climb up that corporate   ladder and encourages women to take more risks \nbe more ambitious in the professional goals gain   confidence demand more and generally gun for \nthose leadership positions but this book is   both for women and for men the men that want to \nsupport their Partners in achieving their goals   and understanding what they have to do I want to \ndo more book reviews on non-personal finance books   as well there's quite a few that have completely \nchanged the way I think and if you're interested   in that then let me know I'll make more of \nthose videos I am also going to record a q   a next week if you have any questions that you \nwant to ask pop them in the comments below or   DM them over on my Instagram and I'll get them \nanswered thank you so much for watching don't   forget to subscribe if you haven't already \notherwise I hope to see you in my next video",

looking so good that not even CNN not even CNN can deny that Trump's economic policies are already working take a look at this uh finally we have some good news on the economy and really the number one issue for many Americans the cost of living so we just learned that consumer prices in February increased by 2.8% year-over-year . 2% month over month both of these figures were a step in the right direction and both were better than expected so this is definitely very encouraging to see because it's going to I think relieve some fears that inflation was perhaps re accelerating because this actually breaks a streak of four straight months where I think you could see it on the chart all the way to the right where the inflation rate was going in the wrong direction right it was going higher and higher finally we're seeing it dip you hear that folks despite all of the Doom saying coming from the Democrats after just 52 days in office president Trump has already completely turned around Joe Biden's never-ending inflation but you know what president Trump's economic success so far goes beyond just inflation take a look at some of these numbers egg prices are down to a buck 83 per dozen gas prices continue to decrease job growth is up with 93% of those jobs being in the price private sector Trump's tariff negotiations have all been successful including with Mexico Colombia Ontario Panama and Ukraine Trump has already secured $741 billion in manufacturing Investments with another $700 billion in the pipeline and guess what border crossings are down 93% so all of that is to say that so far president Trump is absolutely killing it now folks I want you all to hear what president Trump had to say just the other day about this ongoing ridiculous Democrat Narrative of an upcoming recession but first I want to say real quick if you guys enjoy the daily news coverage please consider subscribing to the channel because it really does help a lot with my daily struggle against the YouTube algorithm but okay folks take a look at this Mr President your comments the other day not Brewing out a potential recession seem to Rattle the stock markets the Commerce Secretary said would just specifically on the recession yeah do you think there will be a recession I don't see it at all I think this country is going to Boom but as I said I can do it the easy way or the hard way the hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing but the results are going to be 20 times greater well yeah folks as the saying goes if you want to make an omelet you're going to have to crack a couple eggs over the last couple years the Democrats have done an absolutely insane amount of damage to this country and this country's economy and let's be honest cleaning up their mess isn't going to be easy and it's not going to be fun hard decisions are going to have to be made and yes there might be some short-term struggle for some long-term growth but that is why we all voted for President Trump to put America First and to actually fix these problems rather than just slapping a Band-Aid on them like Joe Biden did now while we're talking about making tough but necessary decisions take a look at this next clip uh I think we're going to have an that's a real economy not a fake economy there a fake economy they were putting an all government jobs you see what happened last week last month we had more real jobs and government jobs are way down that's going to continue those are real jobs those are jobs that keep the country going you can't have all government jobs you have no income to pay the workers and a lot of those workers didn't show up to work that was the other problem so folks now we're talking about real genuine economic growth real American jobs for Americans here in America because here's the thing as we all know Joe Biden artificially propped up our economy for years with unheard of deficit spending and the creation of tens of thousands of unnecessary government public sector jobs anyone remember Joe Biden's 87,000 IRS agents yeah that's the type of stuff that we're talking about and this actually reminds me of one of the funniest jokes about communism you can pretty easily have a 100% employment rate if the government just pays people to dig holes and then fill them back in all day but does that mean that actual productive work is getting done absolutely not so here's the point not all jobs are equal and Trump is focused on creating productive jobs here in America for productive Americans and really it's jobs like that that are the backbone of our economy not 50,000 unnecessary bureaucratic pencil pushers that Joe Biden may have hired and yeah you know what making real productive jobs is more difficult it takes time and negotiation but this is the only way to actually repair the economy and this is something that the Democrats are just completely unwilling to do their solution to everything is just more government spending they think they can tax and spend their way to success when in reality the only way to make America great again is to empower Americans which is exactly what president Trump is doing and so this is why the Democrats are just completely dumbfounded that President Trump's economic plan is actually working because the Democrats very clearly have zero faith in Americans but you know what's happened because of that now Americans have zero faith in the Democrats going from four years of trump into four years of Biden right back into Trump has given people a very clear idea of who's really better at running the country and this is why the Democrats right now have a 21% approval rating whereas president Trump Has His Highest approval ratings of all time right now and you know what it's pretty obvious why as it would turn out if you're the president and you want to earn the approval of the country all you really have to do is work in the best interests of Americans so what does that actually mean well it means shutting down illegal immigration it means no more sending money to foreign countries that no one has ever heard of and it means bringing jobs back to America and guess what these are all things that President Trump is actively doing that the Democrats and Joe Biden never actually did we also know that regarding these decreasing interest rates Elon Musk and the department of government efficiency were 100% right for months they've been saying that as they continue to cut waste and abuse out of our federal budget the interest rates will continue to go down well lo and behold they've cut over1 100 billion dollars worth of waste and abuse already and guess what interest rates are now going down it really makes you question the competence of all of these academically trained Progressive economists when pretty much they're just always wrong about everything but okay folks here's the real takeaway now that President Trump is back in office not only are inflation rates already going back down but Trump is building out every aspect of our economy opening back back up our American domestic energy sector securing hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing Investments repatriating jobs and bringing them back to America you name it Trump is doing it and so folks despite the NeverEnding theatrics of the progressive left this is all a great reminder that with President Trump back in office America First is inevitable but everyone before we wrap up with today's video I want to say real quick that I've actually made a community Facebook page where I'll be posting additional news and updates relating to all of this so if you guys use Facebook check out the pinned comment down below and give that page a follow but now that is going to

that can reason think and do a bunch of cool stuff and it's currently the soda AI model on benchmarks but they have also launched another thing with it and it's called clae code well what's clae code Cloud code is a new tool by them that allows you to code with AI you can start it in a repo and it can start coding in it which is kind of cool if you've used AER then it's very much similar to that currently it's in research preview and it's limited as I'm making this video they are giving out seats to use it on a first come first serve basis and it's free although you'll need to have API credits you can get $5 free credits on their site as well anyway if we talk a bit about it they say that it is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal understands your code base and helps you code faster through natural language commands by integrating directly with your development environment Claud code streamlines your workflow without requiring additional servers or complex setup it's basically a terminal or command line interface that allows you to give it a prompt and it can do file operations and a bunch of stuff with it which is actually quite cool to see the key capabilities include editing files and fixing bugs across your code base answering questions about your code's architecture and logic executing and fixing tests linting and other commands as well as searching through git history resolving merge conflicts and creating commits and PRS installing it is simple you can just run this command which will get clae code installed for you then you can get into the folder where you would like to do the operations and just run the cloud command at first it will ask you to sign in with your anthropic account and then it will get enabled now let me show you how you can use use it how it works and everything like that so this is the interface and it's simple you can send in your prompt about what you want to do and it can do that but before we do that let's just have a look at what all it offers here you have the clear option which will clear up the conversation history and free up your context you also have the compact option which will remove the context but still keep a summary of that context for future reference which is quite good next we have the config option if I open it up here then you can see that we have the following options in it which are verbose mode theme and notifications all of them are self-explanatory you can just hit escape to close after that we have the cost option which will allow us to see the total cost of the session which is good because Claude is expensive we also have doctor which will just check the health of your Cloud code installation and if everything is fine or not with your installation then you've got help which is just details about Cloud code and then you have in it which will initialize a new CLA markdown file with the codebase documentation which means that you'll always have have proper documentation of the code base and what Claud is doing next you have PR comments which is an option to have a look at PLL requests and make it work on that which is quite good you can also submit a bug through here then you have the review option which will review a poll request from GitHub on your behalf and will tell you if it should be merged or not which is quite cool you you also have log out and login options now let's try to do something with it so I have this repo it is a T3 stack one and it's basically just one page that lets me upload a picture and then crop it as well as increase the brightness and exposure now let's ask it to tell me what it thinks this project is about once I send in the prompt then you can see that this works quite well it's fast as well which is great to see now one thing that they recommend is that we run the init command this will create a clawed markdown file which will contain the details about your repo and will be a kind of documentation when it creates a file it will show you the diff and will ask you to approve the stuff as required or you can also cancel it and ask Claude to do it in a different way which is quite good to see now it's done and it did that quite well which is great to see let's try to make it do some coding as well so this app is a T3 stack one and it has the basic page that we get with it which I don't want so let's ask it to remove that and make the image Cropper the main page this is challenging because you need to remove files edit files change Roots which a lot of of coders struggle with once we send it in you can see that it starts thinking through and reading the code files let's wait a bit for it to finish so it has now given me this diff which looks correct let's just approve this here now it wants to run a shell command to check the linting which is a good touch although I'm sure that it will encounter errors here and yes it does let's see how it deals with it so it is now trying to fix it let's see if it's able to or not and it's not able to fix it again okay now it's trying to be like me and is just disabling eslint I like it claude's just like me it just wants to disable eslint anyway it now wants to run the server although this is a bit controversial because I don't think that the server should be run here because I think that it will hang the process and yes it does so anyway I think that it should be up on Port 3000 and yes it is here and it did this correctly the main page is now the Cropper and it is also correct to use so this is good I have seen many coders just remove the node modules or do some stupid stuff like that so this is a pass now one issue that I have here is that the brightness and exposure sliders don't show preview here which is a bummer let's ask Claude to fix this now once I sent it it gave me a bunch of edits which I approved and at eslint checks I said no to it because I don't want to waste tokens and now it's done and it works well in one shot this is a complex thing to do because you need to render the image but this is cool to see that's basically how you can use it it works well and you can also use the git options that it has like code review and stuff which is all great I think that this is actually quite amazing to use and it surely gives competition to things like ader and Klein overall it's pretty cool

More than you may realize. Austerity through two successive,\nextraordinarily expensive and damaging crises, has left the UK\nwith an enormous debt burden. Compared to our friends here or here, or in fact, in any major advanced economy, national debt in the UK has ballooned\nthe most since Covid. But it's not just borrowing\nthat's an issue. Look at tax revenue\nas a percentage of GDP. Basically,\nthe share of the country's output that the government takes to pay for what\nthe public needs. It's almost as high as when what\nthe public most needed were bomb shelters. And in an election year,\nthat's a massive problem for whoever's tasked with writing a new spending plan. We can't raise taxes,\ncan't really let debt go much higher. And yet, public services\nare crying out for more money. Britain has appointed\nas many prime ministers in the last five years as Taylor Swift's released\nre-recorded studio albums. Four, to be precise. So the question is, can a new UK\ngovernment fix the problem its predecessors couldn’t? The next government is inheriting\nan incredibly difficult legacy. The burden of taxes on the economy\nat a 70 year high. Public services are creaking at the seams. Record waiting lists\nin the National Health Service. Parts of the justice system\nhave had nearly a halving of the number of courts\nthat are operating. You get the picture,\nand it's not a pretty one. Some of this is down to government\nspending during the pandemic, which is bigger than any G7 economy\nas a share of GDP, bar the US. We are providing 280 billion pounds to get our country through coronavirus. But here's the thing. Most of that money was borrowed from creditors\nwhen interest rates were down around here, at historic lows, and repayments\nwere expected to be relatively manageable. And they might have been. But then... The Russian assault has begun. The largest invasion of a neighboring\ncountry in Europe since World War II. The invasion triggered an energy crisis,\nas Europe's access to vital Russian oil and gas was choked by sanctions\nand trade restrictions. UK households will pay almost triple the price to heat their homes\nthis winter compared with a year ago. We're in the middle\nof a national emergency. People are really scared and families\ndon't know if they could warm their homes this winter. The cost of living began to soar\nand the UK was once again the second most generous\nwith financial support, behind only Italy. Overall, 400 billion pounds\nor so in additional spending, all of which went into debt, and\nall of which gave us the biggest increase in debt as a share of our\neconomy, of any G7 economy. The twin impacts of the pandemic\nand the energy crisis pushed our inflation rate to new highs,\nand forced central banks to ramp up\nthe interest rate in an effort to halt it. And if you're lucky enough to own\nyour own home, you may remember that time your mortgage payments went up by hundreds\nof pounds a month, seemingly overnight. Well, this is why. But for the UK government,\nit wasn't repayments for a lovely house, but for hundreds of billions\nof pounds of national debt. The combination of those two events\nhas increased how much it costs to pay for our debt,\nfrom about 40 billion pounds a year to about 100 billion pounds a year. That 60 billion pound increase in spending\njust on debt interest is equivalent\nto the entire defense budget. As a result,\nwe have tens of billions of pounds less to spend on anything else,\nfrom health to police to defense. But the extra borrowing on those crises\ndidn't come with faster growth. In fact, the UK economy has\nbarely expanded past pre-pandemic levels. You can see here only Germany\nhas grown less than the UK in that time, as it was so dependent on cheap\nRussian gas that it faced an existential crisis\nwhen the taps were turned off. Germany is also spending\na far lower proportion of its GDP on servicing its debt, though. So the challenge to the new government is\nhow do you pay off a huge pile of debt without raising taxes or borrowing\nor squeezing public services even harder? Well, one of the best ways to grow\nan economy is to make a nation more productive. What happens with improving productivity\nis that for the same amount of work, you get more out of it. It doesn't mean what many people think it\nmeans, which is just that you have to work harder. If you are working\nin an old fashioned newspaper and you move to a tech company,\nthe tech company is more profitable, has greater margins,\nand you could work less hard. But your contribution\nin terms of productivity to the economy could be greater because you effectively\nare working smarter. In the wake of Brexit and Covid,\nthe UK is in a unique position here. We did inherit a situation where output\nper head productivity in the economy had already been weakening quite dramatically after the global\nfinancial crisis in 2008,2009. Which you can see here, altering a trend that had been in motion since the 1970s. You then have the impact of Brexit,\nwhich had a particularly sharp effect on investment, which we saw feed\nalmost immediately into growth and again pulling down our overall efficiency,\nour output per head. And then Covid has added\nthis extra legacy. Which means we need our heads\nto be working even smarter. But for the time being, we need bodies too\nin the workforce. And here we have another problem. Across the major advanced economies,\nevery country saw an increase in the proportion of people finding jobs and going into the workforce\nor trying to after the pandemic. But look at the UK, we lost workers. More people fell into long term sickness\nand people just dropped out. There's a million people, in a sense,\nmissing from the labor force, many of them claiming disability benefit\nor sitting on NHS waiting lists. One of the drivers of growth\nover the last decade or two prior to the pandemic had been the increase\nin the participation rate. So the proportion of people able\nto work actually doing so. By going into reverse, that has caused\na very particular British problem. Participation has not come back\nsince the lockdowns. That represents\na lot of missing productive capacity. This is all monumental pressure for the\nnext government to withstand and relieve. They need to get the population\nable to work doing so and in a more productive capacity. Then there's wiggle room\nto deal with high interest rates and bring down national debt, freeing up\ntax revenue to bolster public services and support the people unable\nto work in the first place. Everyone agrees\nthis is an enormous challenge, but if it's one the new government can\npull off, the potential gains are massive.", "duration(in seconds)": 433.0, "region": "US"}}

"script": "is coding dead in 2025 [Music] well maybe but not in the way that you think we are not far from a world I think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months where AI is writing 90% of the code and then in 12 months we may be in a world where AI is writing essentially all of the code programming is vital but it's just different now so we're going to break up this video into five parts and explain exactly why coding as we know it is dead in 2025 but why programming is not you you you probably recall over the course of the last 10 years 15 years um almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science everybody should learn how to program and in fact it's almost exactly the opposite it is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human everybody in the world is now a programmer a portion of this video has been sponsored by HubSpot okay so let's first take a step back when you first started to code you probably ended up choosing a highle language like Python Java or JavaScript and then maybe even a framework like React or Spring Boot but what you probably never had to do on the job was code in binary or physically work with a bunch of servers and cables in the little room in the back of your office those were the OG software and hardware engineers and kind of like how every generation before says you never had to work as hard as our generation it's somewhat true okay no we didn't have to painfully write things in binary or assembly but we still have to work harder in other ways we now have so much more information at our disposal that technology changes extremely quickly you always have to think on your feet and there's never any job security likewise coding in these highle languages is kind of like the boomers of the past you no longer have to spend hours on Stack Overflow to try to find the answer in fact you shouldn't because the next developer that comes along is just going to default to using Copilot and they'll be a lot faster and a lot more productive than you understanding this first is extremely important in understanding how to get past the death of coding as we know it today we're talking about vibe coding which is from a Andre Karpathy post that went viral recently there's a new kind of coding I call vibe coding where you fully give in to the vibes embrace exponentials and forget that the code even exists so this is a clip from YC's main channel they're talking about the newly coined term vibe coding and I've heard many different terms for this like the AI assisted developer the noode software engineer you name it vibe coding as the video suggests is just coding off of good vibes essentially not really coding but leaning very heavily on AI to code for you but the truth is people always find a way to market software engineering as something easy to do but if it was easy then everyone would be doing it the problem is there are a lot of software engineers but there are not a lot of decent software engineers and the no code approach doesn't mean no coding it just means less thinking about code a lot less for example if I wanted to build out functionality to hit an API that gave me basketball player stats for the past 5 years in the NBA and then use that data to come up with March Madness picks I would probably spend hours trying to build and deploy said API cleaning the data manually adding processing and ranking logic and then displaying the info on the web page but as a Vibe coder defaulting to AI generated code is a lot faster but here's the thing you still need to understand what to do with the code you can't just throw it into the void and hope that it works you still have to understand what code is needed you need tests that have good coverage using optimal data structures and algorithms utilizing solid principles and understanding the dynamics of system design i'm not saying that it hasn't become easier but the skills required are just shifting okay so leading on this whole no code approach I did mention that coding was dead but programming was not and by programming I just mean building off of intricate software systems this can include manually coding things but it doesn't have to i actually had a recent video where I talked about building AI agents without any code at all the cool thing about AI agents are that they're not just LLMs that summarize things for you they actually take action in that video I go through a demo of Operator by OpenAI where it opens up a browser on the cloud browses the web for grocery items to make apple pie and then orders the groceries for me and I set up an AI agent on my own within 5 minutes as well you can actually check that video out here this technologies limit is endless you can use AI agents to automate entire workflows for you without having to do any code this is the future of programming it's evolved into maintaining and designing overarching systems in a clean way this type of programming can get complicated so if you want a free resource to learn more I'd highly recommend checking out HubSpot's free AI agent playbook this playbook goes over a breakdown of things like what AI agents are and how they work how to get started with AI agents and even some common pitfalls to watch out for it also gives you a foundational understanding of the difference between an AI agent and any old AI chatbot for example as shown here AI agents won't just summarize information for you it'll actually do the thing here the guide shows that if you wanted to find your top performing blog posts and draft social media updates for them the AI agent would connect to an analytics API analyze top posts draft social media posts and even schedule the posts for you my favorite section is actually setting up an AI agent yourself as important as the theory is behind it it won't matter if you don't know how to create an AI agent yourself this guide sets up a framework to follow so you can start creating these agents on your own it even goes into detail about low precision versus high precision task frameworks and the common pitfalls that you should definitely avoid at the very end it even reflects on the relationship between AI and humans this 40-page guide is filled with golden nuggets and it's completely free i've linked the HubSpot guide in the description below so you definitely want to check it out okay now back to the video so in the same video clip that I showed you earlier Jensen talked about domain level expertise being on the rise the countries the people that understand how to solve a domain problem in digital biology or in education of young people or in manufacturing or in farming those people who understand domain expertise now can utilize technology that is readily available to you you now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do but what exactly does that mean in the context of software engineering he means having a deep specialized knowledge in a particular field and that's beyond just the technical skills required for coding now it's not just knowing how to code but also understanding context at a high level and knowing how to effectively apply AI within a new domain for example with healthcare this looks like an engineer that understands medical terminology workflows patient privacy laws and how doctors actually make decisions this gives us the ability to focus our problem solving on using the code rather than creating the code in the best possible way of course which by the way still means having an understanding of the code and the theory and how everything works problem solving has always been the foundation for software engineering so this part hasn't actually changed but if you treat it like a technology change then it'll be a lot easier to adapt to this AI revolution then learning new domains won't be hard either in fact it'll feel more creative as you get to explore the AI architecture side of systems and the domain that you're using these systems for do you remember working on a bug or a coding assignment and you just couldn't get one of the tests to run you had to spend hours looking things up on Stack Overflow or Googling random examples that could maybe be applied to your work this was honestly the most frustrating part of the process for me you may know most of the coding fundamentals but there's always something that you don't know and so you end up relying too much on either the gold or the garbage of the internet because let's be honest both exist now I'm not saying that AI can't give you garbage code it definitely can and I've seen it happen a lot but the cool thing is you don't have to put in the effort to manually search for things so even if it gives you gold or garbage you'll have to sift through that but it'll just be a lot faster and if you don't get what you want it'll at least try to modify things or give you a template to jump off of the old way of coding is definitely dead but there is a new way to program the environment around you and it just takes a new type of software engineer to do these things and the sooner you adapt to these changes the easier it'll be to level up your skills it's a marathon at the end of the day so don't get disheartened if you don't understand things or it doesn't come quickly for you just keep trying and pushing along and you'll eventually get", "duration(in seconds)": 527.0, "region":

gotten a massive new upgrade Firebase Studio is a cloud-based agentic development environment that's powered by Gemini which is going to give developers a full stack AI workspace to build backends frontends mobile apps and so much more all in one unified platform At the Google Cloud Next 2025 Google had unveiled this new studio which is an upgrade to project idx that unifies Firebase Genkit and Gemini into a single cloud-based agentic development environment And this is for building full stack apps AI first applications and so much more We saw what this was capable of doing before with Project IDX on this channel and now it looks like it has gotten even better It supports Gemini AI It has many different types of abilities to prototype test and deploy apps from front end to backend using natural languages You also have the ability to use images 60 plus pre-built templates It features seamless coding workspaces deep git integration flexible deployment options and even an AI powered agent for tasks like mitigation documentation as well as code generation Now Genkit is going to support Python Go and advanced features like rag and multimodel orchestrations while vertex AI is something that will expand access to Gemini image gen 3 and open- source models like llama and mistrol So you can see that this is a hub for you to access all of these different state-of-the-art models as well as these Aentic AI tools to build out anything Also just a quick shout out to my second channel If you haven't already make sure you guys go and subscribe cuz I'm posting daily over here And you can see I have a lot of hidden tools and models that I'm going to be showcasing here and testing them out So make sure you go ahead and subscribe Now what's great is that this still remains free So they're not putting this behind a payw wall cuz you can access three free workspaces which is more than enough And you actually get 30 for the dev program members You also have $300 in credits that is given for free if you are a new user So I guess this is giving you a lot of benefits So what we're going to do is get started and showcase Firebase Studio What you need to do is simply click on get started Before we get started I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the world of AI newsletter I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis So this is where you can easily get up-to-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space So definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free And once you sign up or log in with the Google account you're going to be then sent over to the main dashboard of Firebase Studio But you're going to be greeted unfortunately with this banner which says that they're dealing with high demand So please check back later I tried with the VPN I've also tried multiple different browsers Unfortunately this banner still sticks This is how it's supposed to look In this case someone is going ahead and prompting in to create a newsletter app that has cool animations on hero section So you can see that you can prompt in this uh request to the Firebase studio and you can see that the Gemini model will then work on creating a plan This is where it gives the style guidelines as well as the features for the app Then it's going to go ahead and take the action to execute it just like how bolt new or many of these other ids do it or sorry full stack dev tools do it And you can see it's going to then prototype and build this application for you And there we go This was the animated newsletter app that was built And this was all thanks to the Firebase Studio app powered by the Gemini model And it's essentially where you can access the prototype feature where you can build apps based off of natural language like you would with Bolt as well as many of these other full stack dev tools But what you can do is create a new workspace from scratch And I can showcase all the other features of project or not project ideas of of Firebase Studio And you can see how many different sorts of programming languages that you can start with like Angular all the way to next.js React and you also have Python So you can go ahead and create a new workspace You can also have it so that you can collaborate and import different repos So in this case if I click on this you can see there's different templates from web all the way to miscellaneous databases backend and so many other options that get you started So let's get started with a React app We're going to click on this and we're going to give this a name Let's just name it uh let's just name it World of AI app We're going to keep it as JavaScript and click on create And once it finishes creating it will then send us into the Firebase Studio IDE which is a cloud-based ID that will get you started and help you build anything Now this is something that is super easy to get started with guys and it's completely free So this is a great way for you to prototype and build off of anything Once Firebase Studio sets up your project you'll see that it sets up and initializes your project files It runs all the necessary commands to have the React app running and you can get a visualization of it on the right hand panel On the left hand side you can visualize all your code assets and you can also switch the tab to the Gemini app This is where you can ask it questions You can also make inline edits to certain things and you can highlight the code So in this case you can click on the show code action and it can go ahead and give you the ability to explain the selected code add comments to the code do anything with the selected code So if you ask it uh improve the code it will go ahead and execute this task for you and you can see all the generations being made It will then go ahead and prepare the file changes and it'll give you a visualization of it So you can review the changes actually of all the necessary edits and then you can obviously go ahead and update the file if you approve it So if you think about it Firebase Studio has combined the full stack dev tools capabilities that you would see with both Vzero and many of these other apps with the ability to prototype with natural language and then combine it with an IDE that is Agentic similar to how you would access Cursor or many of these other AI applications or IDE like windsurf So you've combined both of these tool amazing things and you get such amazing capabilities especially having it powered by these Gemini models So this is where I'm going to go ahead and have it create this finance app for me that lets me visualize my income and expenses And you can see the plan it has made now And you can see it's asking if you have any preferred stock data API I just said just create dummy data for now And you can go ahead and have it uh go code out everything that is ne necessary You can then have it execute backend server commands So in this case this command failed So it will go back and execute the command that will be necessary to start this up So we're going to go ahead and have it execute all these different commands and showcase what it has built And there we go We have opened it up within our local host And this is what I was capable of generating with a single prompt which is just insane Now we have our daily cash flow being visualized The expense breakdown with our income balance stock value as well as our expenses All of our transactions could be noted down here as well as our stocks So you can see overall you have a good visualization of each of these stocks and it gives you a good understanding of your income as well as your expenses and your stocks So it did get the job done with a single prompt and this is the capability that you get You can prototype and build applications quite quickly within this new Firebase Studio If you like this video and would love to support the channel you can consider donating to my channel through the super thanks option below Or you can consider joining our private Discord where you can access multiple subscriptions to different AI tools for free on a monthly basis plus daily AI news and exclusive content plus a lot more Overall this is a great way for you to prototype and build applications while getting the capability of an Aenic AI IDE So this is something that I highly recommend that you try out as it's completely free with no rate limits and it's something that you can get started with today Now I'll leave this link as well as everything that I use in the description below Make sure you subscribe to the newsletter as well as my second channel the Patreon as well as subscribing to the Twitter page

is very very taped up his knee all up his knee is taped up now I don't know if that's because he's injured or because he wants friction if he grabs a hold of something in a guard and he he wants Brock Lesnar to not be able to slip out Brock with the inside leg kick early Joe pawing trying to keep Frank Mir at distance Frank Mir looks very calm and collected here and Brock immediately goes for the taked down Frank Dives down he's got a hold of a leg and he slips to half guard Joe we've heard no reports of any trouble with the left knee or the left leg of Frank Mir you never know though you know you never know you never know well and as you know the way these guys train rarely do we have a fighter truly at 100% when he finally enters the Octagon the one thing you notice here is Lesnar being very patient he's got Frank Mir down but he's not swinging away trying to finish it right away like he did the first time thus he got caught he doesn't want to take any chances and Frank very relaxed on the bottom let's work come on let's work [Applause] Brock now this is Frank's game the the more Brock falls into this the more Brock is not grounded pounding and just trying to Grapple with him he runs runs the risk his work you see that there you see that heat and short elbow and there's a cut on the bridge in the nose ofir as well but as I said the the more Brock grapples with Frank on the ground the more he runs the risk of being submitted especially right now when both of them are slippery well you notice to Brocks trying to stay chest on chest he doesn't want to leave any Gap good punches by Brock there between him and Frank Mir to allow Meir to spin the hips and work a submission yeah he's he's controlling Frank's head and punching him in the face and these are hard punches pushes the arm back and again delivers a shot now Frank is protecting his face with his hand but he's bleeding Mike Brock is firing away and again he's got that pressure Joe of chest on chest yeah and Brock can generate incredible amount of power in that short distance Frank very relaxed on the bottom though you see he's not really trying to fight it off what work bro what's work Brock's Pace very deliberate those punches are very hard championship fight five five minute rounds Frank just looked over at his Corner said I'm okay I'm okay Brock just teeing away though those that one got now he's got he realizes he's got to move these are hurting 2 minutes remains in round one that is just a big big powerful dude yeah he is doing a lot of damage here Mike Mike his Frank mir's nose is bleeding his cheek is all bruised up he just gave his Corner the thumbs up but that's all well and good but you got those big lunch boxes slamming into your face that's not a lot of fun oh now he goes to the body and to the face 90 seconds remains in the round all right now Frank's in a better spot Frank looks around looking for the clock I would assume all Brock here in round one the way Brock is holding Frank's neck he's almost got him in like a neck crank he's holding the armpit and he's pushing the face forward Frank can't move his head very well Brock was going body body face now too [Applause] Joe all right this is much better for Frank his head's free but now you know he's taking some damage what Brock is there's Brock now Brock's got to be careful here Joe yeah as when he leaves distance yep Frank's going to start to move and look to lock something in and that may be the best thing he's done here in round one is chest on chest good Hammer [Applause] fist now this one's lasted much longer than the first one already [Applause] underhook by Frank and he's going to use that either try to stand up or he's going to go under the right leg of Brock Lesnar he's running out of time here final seconds of round one hammer fist again the champion wins round one he's got a smile on his face Joe he's got a smile on his face but that face is busted up fight round [Applause] two knee by Frank and they go to the ground wow Brock's going to let him up 106 and five as a Collegiate wrestler good left H by Mir knee by he caught him with the knee oh it jumped up a flying knee all UAH Faber but now Brock's on top again Joe I'm astounded that Brock stood back [Applause] up Brock's best game plan is to do exactly this not get into a strike fest with Frank Mir if he doesn't work here herb Dean's going to stand him up herb is warning them right now [Applause] [Applause] Frank is getting beat up here he's taking some big shots and his face is splattering blood all over his shoulder the power shots of Brock Lesnar he's got so much power in those fists Mike up big Lesnar trying to finish it per is there and it is all over out Brock Lesnar is the Undisputed UFC heavyweight champion wow that's not going to win him any fans that was he cares that's I don't think he cares at all that was real said Frank he said talk all the you want now Rel [Applause] himone and here you see this just big powerful fist come down on Frank mir's face Frank is pressed up against the cage and and as soon as he turned over referee Herb Dean gave him plenty of chances but he realized that Frank wasn't getting [Applause] up Total Domination the power of Brock Lesnar in these punches and and again Frank just stuck there pinned up against the cage unable to [Applause] move Brock Lesnar who grew up on

Iran's air force for decades Iran's air force has relied on outdated fighter jets including the F-14 Tomcat and MiG 29 many of which date back to the pre979 era following the Islamic Revolution international sanctions severely restricted Iran's ability to acquire modern Western aircraft such as the F-16 or F-35 leaving it at a technological disadvantage meanwhile regional adversaries like Israel Saudi Arabia and the UAE expanded their air capabilities with F-35s Euro fighters and Rafaels to bridge this capability gap Iran sought an alternative solution ultimately securing the Sue35 a powerful and cost-effective fighter jet that significantly enhances its air combat readiness strategic and geopolitical impact and Russia have gradually strengthened their military ties culminating in the Sue 35 deal as part of a broader defense partnership pilot training to prepare its pilots for advanced fighter operations Iran acquired Yak 130 trainer jets enabling a smooth transition to high performance aircraft technology transfer as part of the agreement Iran began assembling Sue 35s locally gaining critical expertise in fighter jet production and maintenance future access to advanced fighters this collaboration could serve as a stepping stone for Iran to acquire next generation aircraft like the Sue 57 or Sue75 Checkmate by integrating local assembly and technology transfer this landmark deal enhances Iran's military self-sufficiency while cementing its strategic defense alliance with Russia positioning both nations as key players against Western influence iran's SU35 acquisition a gamecher in Middle Eastern air power after months of speculation and intense negotiations Iran has finally begun receiving its long anticipated most advanced 4th.5 generation SU35 fighter jets from Russia this is far more than just another military deal it is a strategic turning point that has the potential to reshape the balance of power in the Middle East with the arrival of these advanced aircraft Iran is entering a new era of aerial warfare implications for the region with an expected delivery of 60 SUE35s by 2025 this is the largest fighter jet acquisition in Iran's modern history however Iran is not merely importing these jets it is also assembling some locally which signals potential ambitions for domestic fighter production why the Sue35 iran's choice of the Sue35 stems from its cuttingedge capabilities including super maneuverability for aerial superiority advanced radar systems that can track multiple targets longrange operational capabilities over the Persian Gulf and beyond seamless integration with Iran's existing defense infrastructure technical advantages of the Sue35 the Sue35 Flanker E is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world significantly boosting Iran's air force with its cuttingedge capabilities engines and maneuverability saturn AL41 F1s engines with thrust vectoring allow for extreme aerial maneuvers and superior agility speed and range maximum speed of MAC 2.2550 25 1,550 mph with a combat range of over 1,000 mi super cruise capability maintains supersonic flight without afterburners improving fuel efficiency

ground attacks with this formidable combination of speed maneuverability advanced sensors and lethal firepower the Sue35 transforms Iran's aerial combat capabilities giving it a modern and competitive edge in the region impact on regional military dynamics iran's Sue35 acquisition could challenge the air superiority of Israel the United States and Persian Gulf states extended operational range allows Iran to project power over the Persian Gulf straight of Hormuz and even parts of the Eastern Mediterranean stronger air defense capabilities could improve Iran's ability to intercept enemy aircraft before they reach Iranian airspace enhanced deterrence makes any military intervention against Iran riskier for adversaries electronic warfare potential could disrupt surveillance and reconnaissance operations from rival nations iran's future fighter jet ambitions while the Sue35 is a major leap forward analysts suggest Iran may be eyeing fifth generation stealth fighters in the near future recently reports surfaced of a Russian Sue 57 felon stealth fighter making an unannounced stop in Iran speculation suggests Iranian officials inspected the aircraft as a potential future acquisition a more feasible option might be the Sue75 Checkmate a lighter single engine stealth fighter currently in development by Russia if Iran secures a deal for the Sue75 it could significantly enhance its stealth capabilities while reducing foreign dependency other reports suggest Iran may also be considering Chinese options such as the Chungdu J10C to further diversify its air force long-term strategic vision iran's sue35 deal with Russia is about more than just immediate air power it is a long-term investment in domestic aviation capabilities reports confirm that at least six sue 35s are currently being assembled in Iran under the supervision of Russian technicians a significant step in technology transfer pilot training iran has acquired 12 Yak 130 advanced jet trainers to prepare pilots for high performance fighter operations local assembly enables Iranian engineers to gain critical experience reducing dependency on foreign suppliers and strengthening self-sufficiency in military aviation potential for future collaboration iran's growing defense cooperation with Russia could lead to further technological advancements including potential involvement

out for very different reasons the ja 39 gpin Sweden's agile and cost efficient Warrior and the F35 lightning 2 America's stealthy and technologically dominant Powerhouse one is a 4.5 generation fighter designed for high maneuverability rapid turnaround and affordability the other is a fifth generation stealth aircraft built to dominate the skies with Advanced sensors and electronic warfare both have strengths both have weaknesses but which one truly excels where it matters most today we put them head-to-head to determine which fighter jetpack the bigger punch for Modern Warfare but before getting to the main discussion let's take a look at the overview of the both [Music] Fighters the Jazz 39 gpin is a testament to efficient and versatile fighter design developed by Saab in the late 20th century it was designed to replace Sweden's aging Fleet while prioritizing multi-roll capabilities cost Effectiveness and Rapid deployment its lightweight Canard delta wing configuration enhances maneuverability making it highly agile in air combat this adaptability allows it to perform air-to-air combat ground attack and reconnaissance missions making it a true multi-roll [Music] aircraft the latest variant the gpin EF brings Cutting Edge avionics a more powerful engine and an advanced electronic warfare Suite keeping it competitive in modern air combat a key upcoming upgrade is Sweden's plan to arm the gpin with the Taurus KD 350 cruise missile a long-range Precision strike weapon with a range exceeding 500 km once integrated by 2028 this will significantly boost the green 's ability to neutralize fortified enemy targets from standoff distances but how does it compare to the F35 the F35 lightning 2 represents a major leap in stealth and multi-roll fighter technology developed Under The Joint Strike Fighter program it was designed to provide a common platform for various branches of the US Military and Allied Nations one of its most defining features is its stealth technology which allows it to evade radar detection and penetrate heavily defended airspace undetected Beyond stealth the F35 boasts Advanced avionics including Sensor Fusion and network Centric Warfare capabilities giving Pilots unmatched situational awareness and the ability to share real-time Battlefield data with other assets the fighter comes in three primary variants each tailored for different operational needs the f-35a designed for conventional takeoff and Landing the f-35b capable of short takeoff and vertical Landing for use on amphibious assault ships and the f-35c optimized for carrier-based operations with a larger wingspan and reinforced landing gear now let's compare them [Music] head-to-head when it comes to speed the gpin holds the edge with a top speed of Mach 2 making it faster and more agile than the F-35 which maxes out at Ma 1.6 its lightweight Canard delta wing design enhances maneuverability making it an excellent choice for dog fighting the F35 while slower takes a different approach it leverages stealth and Sensor Fusion to dominate Beyond visual range engagements allowing it to strike before being detected but speed isn't everything range and Firepower matter too the F-35 outperforms the gpin in endurance boasting a combat range of 2,200 km compared to the gin's 1,500 km it also carries a heavier payload up to 18,000 lb of weapons surpassing the gpin 13,000 lb however Sweden is leveling the playing field by integrating the Taurus KD 350 cruise missile a Precision strike weapon with a range of over 500 km by 2028 this upgrade will significantly enhance the gin's long-range strike capabilities of course a modern fighter jet is nothing without stealth and that's where the F35 truly excels its low radar cross-section and internal weapons Bays make it nearly invisible to enemy detection the gpin on the other hand lacks stealth shaping but it compensates with a powerful electronic warfare Suite using gallium nitrite technology it can jam enemy Radars disrupt missile guidance and electronically evade detection while the F-35 relies on stealth to survive the GP encounters with electronic warfare making it highly effective in contested airspace when it comes to operational flexibility the gpin is built for maximum versatility it can take off and land on short or improvised runways including highways and remote air strips giving it a major advantage in decentralized operations its rugged design and quick turnaround time enable High sorty rates making it an ideal choice for nations with limited infrastructure the F-35 in contrast requ Ires well-maintained air bases to perform at its best its maintenance intensive nature and longer servicing times can limit the number of missions it can fly in a given period cost is another key factor the gpin E is significantly more affordable with a unit cost of around $85 million the f-35a while more advanced comes at a higher price around 100 million per unit this Stark difference makes the gpin a more budget friendly option for Nations looking to balance performance with affordability in terms of combat capabilities the gpen E integrates the meteor missile offering Superior air-to-air combat performance along with a gallium nitride based electronic warfare Suite that enhances survivability in high threat environments Sweden is also preparing to equip the gpin with the Taurus KD 350 missile by 2028 adding long-range Precision strike capabilities that will significantly boost its lethality the F35 on the other hand excels in networked Warfare it features Cutting Edge radar systems Sensor Fusion and Advanced Data sharing capabilities allowing it to coordinate seamlessly with Allied Forces and maintain a dominant situational awareness over the battlefield on the global stage the F-35 has been widely adopted with over 1,000 units delivered across 17 countries making it the most widely used fifth generation

But that's exactly \nwhat Donald Trump is doing. Just hours after the   announcement of these blanket tariffs, which \ntanked the market, terrified economists, and   even have some Republicans saying, we've got to do \nsomething to block this crap. Caroline Levett went   out onto the White House lawn and attempted to \ndefend it. to CNN's Kate Baldwin. The problem is   there's no way to defend this. And so Kate Baldwin \nasks Caroline Levitt, does this mean higher prices   for Americans? How much of this short term pain \nis OK? And Caroline Levett doesn't really answer.  I mean, in the most immediate, I mean these \nfarmers, as Tom Silla says, farmers are one   crop away from bankruptcy. That farmer doesn't \nhave time to wait for tariffs to work their way   into the system, the benefit of it to work its \nway into this system at all. This is going to   mean higher prices for Americans. In the most \nimmediately, that's why I asked the question,   how much pain on a on a temporary basis. is \nokay. What's the standard that the president   is looking at in terms of how much pain Americans \ncan feel on a temporary basis that he's okay with?  Again, the president is focused every single \nday on lowering the cost of living in this   country while simultaneously implementing \nthese very effective tariffs. Massive   deregulation, an energy boom, and tax cuts are the \neconomic formula that will mean more prosperity in   the lower cost of a living. And it's a...\nAnd of course, sure, it's not wrong that   growth will help Americans. The problem is \nthat Trump policy isn't going to generate   growth. And if you're feeling that that like \nthat answer leaves things a little bit lacking,   you're right. And it's because there is no way \nto defend what they are currently doing. Um,   Kate Baldwin pointed out to Caroline love it. \nMarkets are just collapsing. What do you say about   that? And she goes, Oh, Trump knows what he's.\nWhat is the White House reaction to,   as we just had those numbers up, global markets \ntumbling this morning and futures down sharply?  To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I \nwould say trust in President Trump. This   is a president who is doubling down on his \nproven economic formula from his first term.  Just trust him.\nWe saw wages increase.   We saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy \nboom. We had the largest tax cuts in history. And   that's exactly what the president intends to do \nfollowing his historic announcement yesterday for   reciprocal tariffs. It's the golden age rule for \nthe golden Age of America and the United States of   America is no longer going to be cheated.\nThis would make Soviet propaganda   broadcasters blush.\nBy foreign nations   around the world and as the president declared \nyesterday. This is indeed a national emergency   We have a 1.2 trillion dollar trade deficit and \ncounting we've had 90,000 factories closed in the   last couple of decades since 1997 Americans \nhave been put out of 5 million manufacturing  She goes on and on and on and on. \nThe message is close your eyes,   put your noise canceling headphones on and just \ntrust Trump. And the reason that that's all they   have is because there is nothing else. There \nis no economic justification for what they're   doing. It completely contradicts basic economics. \nFinally, sort of the cherry on top. Kate Baldwin   points out, you know, these blanket tariffs \nmay violate some provisions of international   agreements like NATO, Caroline Levy just goes now.\nThe foreign minister of Norway in Brussels for   NATO meetings said this morning that the tariffs \ncould violate an article of the NATO treaty that   orders members to promote economic stability and \ncollaboration. If this is a breach of the NATO   treaty, will the president reassess his approach?\nNo, the president is firm in his approach and the   president is ensuring economic stability \nhere in the United States of America.  And of course, the idea that Trump cares about \nAmerican commitments based on treaties we've   signed in our parties to. This is a different \nera. Kate Baldwin, of course he doesn't care   about that. You know, no matter how well prepared \nyou are, you really can't defend something as   indefensible as what we're seeing right now. \nAnd that's the problem for Caroline Levitt.   Remember that the only way to reach you directly. \nIs our newsletter.

further insights on what repercussions we can expect from Trump's latest terrorist let's speak now with uh Edward Elden a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations hi Edward on balance can I start by asking you this is this what you were anticipating a sliding scale with much higher tariffs for America's so-called worst offenders and and coming down to that flat 10% base tax for everyone else no this is considerably more dramatic considerably more consequential than anything Donald Trump suggested during the election campaign and even larger I think than some of us were anticipating over the last couple of weeks i mean if we look honestly at this it's really a declaration of economic war on the whole world and I don't think any of us expected anything uh quite that dramatic so Edward how do you think success or failure of these far-reaching tariffs will be measured by the Trump administration and just how effective do you think these reciprocal tariffs will be in achieving his goals well I mean I think you have to take him at face value when he explains what his goals are he wants to raise substantial revenue for the US Treasury his trade White House trade adviser Peter Navaro has said the US government anticipates $600 billion a year in tariff revenue he would like to cut other taxes needs the revenue to do that he suggested that the revenue will be sufficient to reduce the US national debt uh perhaps even he made references to the income tax being established in 1913 he even seemed to suggest we could go back to the good old days before the income tax so everything that he said on the podium in the Rose Garden today suggest that these tariffs are not a negotiating tactic uh he intends for them to be in place for some significant period of time and to raise massive revenue for the US government and to force companies if they wish to sell in the US market to set up their businesses in the United States so this is a complete repudiation of the the world of global supply chains that has been built up over the last half century under US leadership edward we know that Trump has not spared airlines 24% for Japan and 26% on all imports from India he's calling these numbers kind and half of what these countries are supposedly charging the United States but they will no doubt be shocking to Tokyo and New Delhi i'm wondering if uh these Asian countries are going to take kindly first of all to to what they're facing and also of course I guess how damaging is it going to be for Asian countries which are high on the tariff chart i mean I you know I have to think extremely damaging you look at at Vietnam correct me if I get the number wrong here but I think it was a 46% tariff imposed on Vietnam vietnam as you know well has been a major beneficiary of the relocation of production from China again a a policy that the US pursued the US put pressure on companies to move out of China many of those companies have uh set up facilities in other parts of Southeast Asia yet none of these countries was spared from high tariffs so I think we have to imagine it's going to be extremely damaging for the economies in your region in terms of their response it's a very hard one i mean they can retaliate but of course retaliatory tariffs hurt your own people they raise prices they hurt your importers uh in the executive order the president has made it clear he may increase the duties if countries uh retaliate i think what we're going to be seeing is a sort of scrambling for a collective response i don't think uh any any country is really you know with the possible exception of the EU collectively is really capable of hitting back on a level that will materially affect the United States and perhaps get Trump to change direction and and for most Americans I guess the key question would be will this make their lives more expensive how much economic strain can American consumers and industry bear from these farreaching tariffs and what's the timeline for when they will start feeling that impact i mean I think you know pretty quickly as you've noted these tariffs are going to be fully uh in place by the middle of next week there'll be some grace period for shipments on the water but but I think you know in in highprofile uh items cars being a very obvious one the prices are going to go up they're going to go up uh quickly and I think Americans are going to feel that uh by all accounts one of the reasons Donald Trump was elected was the high inflation in the early years of the Biden administration americans want to see that brought under control so I I think you're going to see a pretty significant push back i think it's going to come pretty quickly the Republicans who as you know are so loyal to the president are still engaged in wishful thinking we have the chairman of the powerful ways and means committee still praising this as a negotiating tactic to get other countries to lower tariffs as Trump did in his first term but I don't think that's what we're looking at we're looking at something fundamentally different at Donald Trump trying to remake the American economy as a protected economy rather than an open economy that is a radical radical transformation that I don't think his supporters really get yet but they will figure it out okay uh Edward we'll have to end the

Hence why this video exists.\n\n#Gamedev #Programming #java", "tags": "goodgis, ohio, devlog, game dev, indie dev, game programming, game process, how to make, firith, firith studio", "script": "Java has always fascinated me not only is it the most delicious sounding programming language I've ever heard but some of my favorite childhood games like RuneScape and Minecraft were made using it it was created to let programmers write once and run everywhere meaning Java code automatically works on other operating systems without having to recompile which is truly a beautiful thing and ever since it's release in 1995 it has remained one of the most popular programming languages needless to say I've been anxious for a long time to try it out and see what I can do with it now I must confess when I was 12 before I even made video games I went to my local library and picked up this book called programming video games for the Evil Genius a pretty cheesy name for a book that was just about learning Java of course after skim reading a chapter or two and trying to copy the code I quickly became frustrated and completely gave up so fast forwarding almost 15 years later I think it's time for me to redeem myself and see if I can actually make a game from scratch using Java not scratch I mean Java you get you get what I'm saying so starting off on my Java Quest I did something that I haven't done in a while and that was actually taking a little Java course on my phone and by take a course I mean I just kind of did a couple levels to get a feel for what the syntax was like and honestly if you're a beginner or new to programming languages uh I feel like this is just like a good thing to do it just kind of gives you a general idea before you just start jumping into it anywh who after I was done getting familiar with the basics I downloaded Eclipse which is an IDE and just in case you don't know what that is it's basically just software that you use to code in but this one's specifically for Java and I seem to remember using an IDE called net beans as a kid but Eclipse seems a lot more popular now so I just figured I would go with the crowd after that I set off to create a simple hello world program which was pretty straightforward basically you just create a package and I named it Maine and then you create a class and I also called it main I know it's confusing just trust me on it after that I slapped in the classic system out print line hello world and there you go your first Java program I did it so after getting my feet wet I knew I was ready to start working on my real project instead of CR a little mini game like I normally do for these kinds of videos I want to do something I've been dreaming about for a while now and that's making an RPG and I'm not talking about rocket launchers here I mean like an old grindy RPG that you would play on the NES games like Dragon Quest and Earthbound Beginnings I don't know why but I find these games simplistic art style super strange characters and repetitive combat to be so Charming they always feel so empty yet so full of character at the same time so now we know what direction the game's going to take it's time for us to do something basic and that's just draw a window and no I'm not talking about getting out a box of crayons and drawing a house with a window I'm talking about that frame that you see on your desktop when you play a game luckily for us Java has its own built-in container class called jframe meaning our game can be built purely with Vanilla Java so I set up jframe and made some of the parameters any who after doing all that I was able to successfully draw a window and as you can tell I was very excited next I created two new classes entity and player I'm planning on making NPCs later on so creating an entity class allows me just to reuse that code for the player and NPC for example like drawing their Sprites or checking for collisions and speaking of Sprites I was able to load and draw the Sticky's image make a move around the screen so yay I should also point out that I found this wonderful tutorial series by rynow and it was beyond helpful he does a really good job explaining how all this works so if you want to know more about the nitty-gritty details and all the code definitely check it out next I want to dive into creating a tile map system this is something that has always been intimidating for me for some reason it turns out to be super easy essentially all you have to do is create a text file full of numbers the numbers represent different types of tiles like zero is water and like one is grass and two is sand then all you need to do is load the data into an array and then slap it into a for Loop boom you got yourself a tile map and that's great and all but how do you make a camera system so that the player like can move around a larger tile ma area well the trick is instead of moving the player you move the tile set after that I made an if statement to see what tiles were on screen that way I could save performance by only rendering what the player could see and last I created collisions so you couldn't just like walk on the water so there you go now as you can tell the artwork is looking a little rough around the edges and since 50% of RPGs is just artwork I felt like we probably should update this now my original idea was to create a vector art style inspired by Byron be's Pokemon world map illustrations I've been a big fan of his work for a while and thought an RPG could look Super Fresh in this style though I quickly realized that higher resolution Vector artwork wasn't going to scale well down into pixels so this led me to kind of just create this same style but using pixel art instead I thought the results of this were kind of cool but I personally felt like this missed that quirky charm that I wanted to emulate in my favorite NES RPGs so after a slightly iterative process and the use of the NES color palette I ended up with this my animal inspired RPG so with that done I got to work replacing and adding in all the new tiles and artwork I also found that pixel edit the pixel art software I use has a feature that lets you export tiles out as a text file essentially turning my art software into my level editor which was pretty sweet after this I felt like the sound aspect of the game needed to be addressed so I jumped into lab tur I generated a couple of different sounds and then added them to the game I especially love this door sound when you enter a house it just It's oddly satisfying for music I made it myself using beatbox which I haven't used before I was surprised how easy it was to pick up but uh my song's a little clunky so let me know what you think after that I created a pausing State system so you can eventually look at your inventory and view your stats and I also Drew this text onto the screen so that text is actually a font I also know that world maps are a pretty big deal in these types of RPGs so I jumped back into pixel edit and made this kind of smaller world map just as a test run to see how I liked it this also means I had to create a room transition system so you could go from towns to the Overworld right now there's only one town but I think it's it's pretty cool it's start starting to feel like an RPG at this point I knew it was probably time to add NPCs I mean they're such a critical part using that entity system I mentioned earlier was super easy and made adding these NPCs take no time at all and then I add a dialogue system so I could have Bears say weird things like this and with that we have a basic RPG structure we're still missing combat which is the most crucial part of the game but I want to save that for a future video because this was a project I just really enjoyed working on I can't explain it but making a game without a game engine is super satisfying it's difficult and frustrating especially when you know you could do it 10 times faster using something else but it's also really rewarding cuz you know that you made it yourself I have a lot of plans what I could do with this RPG in the future even just as a passion project please let me know if you like to see more of it if not I'll probably just continue to work on it on my own time overall I really enjoy Java I think this has probably been my favorite language I've used so far in this series I highly highly recommend you check out RN's tutorial series on Java it's unbelievably helpful it explains everything that I

THE RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK IS  DESPERATELY TRYING TO TAMP DOWN  INFLATION, BUT THE MORE WE  LOOKED INTO THE STORY, WE  REALIZED IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT  INFLATION, IT'S ABOUT A SUPER  HEATED WAR ECONOMY AT RISK OF  GOING SUPER NOVA IN THE WORST  WAY POSSIBLE.  INTEREST RATES IN RUSSIA ARE  HIGH RIGHT NOW BECAUSE INFLATION IS HIGH.  ALMOST 9% LAST MONTH.  IT'S BEEN IN THAT RANGE FOR  ABOUT A YEAR NOW BUT FOOD  STAPLES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY  EXPENSIVE, BREAD UP 12% THE LAST YEAR, APPLES UP 14%, MILK UP  15%, CABBAGE UP 26%, BUTTER UP  30%, ONIONS UP 33%, AND POTATOES UP 74%.  [SPEAKING ALTERNATE LANGUAGE].  >> Andrew: GROCERY STORES HAVE  SEEN A SPIKE IN THEFTS.  GO AHEAD AND GOOGLE RUSSIA  BUTTER THEFT.  SOME KEEP THEIR STOCK BEHIND  LOCK AND KEY.  RUSSIA CENTRAL BANK HAS DONE  WHAT CENTRAL BANKS HAVE DONE  AROUND THE WORLD TO REIGN IN  INFLATION.  >> RAISED INTEREST RATES.  >> TO 20%.  >> TO 21%.  >> Andrew: BUT THERE IS A STEEP  PRICE OF MAKING THE COST OF  BORROWING THAT HIGH.  FOR SOME RUSSIANS, IT WILL MAKE  THE OPTION OF HOME OWNERSHIP  IMPOSSIBLE.  CORPORATE BANKRUPTCIES IN RUSSIA HAS JUMPED 20% THIS YEAR AND  INTEREST RATES ARE SQUARELY TO  BLAME.  >> THERE ARE FIRMS THAT RELIED  ON BORROWING FROM THE BANK.  THEN YOUR LOAN REPAYMENT SOARS.  >> Andrew: MORE THAN 200 MALLS  FACED BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE OF THE  HIGH COST OF FINANCING.  EVEN THE COMPANIES WHO ARE  STAYING AFLOAT HAVE TO MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES.  TAKE RUSSIAN RAILWAYS.  STATE OWNED, THE BIGGEST  OPERATOR IN THE COUNTRY,  PASSENGER AND FREIGHT, AND  ACCORDING TO A LEADING BUSINESS  DAILY IN RUSSIA, THE LOANS HAVE  BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE.  DESPITE FIGURING THAT THEY NEED  TO SPEND AROUND 1.3 TRILLION  RUBLES OR $17 BILLION CANADIAN,  JUST TO MAINTAIN INVESTMENT  LEVELS, THEY'RE PLANNING TO  SCALE IT BACK BY MORE THAN A  THIRD.  THAT MEANS SACRIFICING EXPANSION PLANS TO INSTEAD PAY BALLOONING  INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT HAVE  REPORTEDLY GONE UP ABOUT  $4 BILLION U.S. SINCE RATES  STARTED SHOOTING UP.  HERE'S THE BIGGER PROBLEM, THIS  TRADITIONAL LEVER OF COOLING  INFLATION BY HIKING INTEREST  RATES ISN'T WORKING.  WHAT'S ULTIMATELY DRIVING  INFLATION IN RUSSIA IS PUTIN'S  WAR MACHINE ITSELF.  SUPER CHARGING AN ECONOMY BY  GOING TO WAR CAN MAKE IT  VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT HAS ALL  THE APPEARANCES OF AN ECONOMIC  BOOM, RIGHT? EVERYONE IS WORKING, INCREDIBLE  AMOUNTS OF MONEY ARE BEING  SPENT, BUT IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY  THE MARKET, IT'S DRIVEN BY  GOVERNMENT SPENDING.  IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE.  >> THE DEMAND IN THE ECONOMY IS  SKEW IN THE FAVOUR OF  UNPRODUCTIVE EXPENDITURES ON  MILITARY AND DEFENCE.  >> Andrew: THIS EXPERTS SAY, IS  THE CASE IN RUSSIA WHERE THE  GOVERNMENT HAS MADE THE WAR IN  UKRAINE THE SINGLE BIGGEST  PRIORITY.  MILITARY SPENDING NOW CONSUMES  ONE-THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S  OVERALL BUDGET.  JUST FOR CONTEXT, ALMOST NO  OTHER COUNTRY SPENDS THAT MUCH  OF THEIR MONEY ON DEFENCE.  UKRAINE IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION.  THIS PUTS PRESSURE ON THE LABOUR FORCE.  I'LL EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN.  WHEN THE DEFENCE MINISTER IN  APRIL TOURED A TANK PRODUCTION  FACILITY, THEY SAID THEY WEREN'T JUST MEETING, BUT EXCEEDING  PRODUCTION TARGETS.  THE PLANT JUST HIRED 1,200  PEOPLE, WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO PUMP OUT TANKS, ARMOURED  VEHICLES, AND FLAME THROWERS AND TO MAINTAIN THAT KIND OF  PRODUCTION SCHEDULE, YOU NEED  PEOPLE, LOTS OF PEOPLE.  LOOK AT RUSSIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE, DOWN NEAR 2%.  THAT'S DRIVEN BY TWO THINGS.  >> DEFENCE INDUSTRIES WHERE  ACCORDING TO RUSSIAN OFFICIAL  STATISTICS, OVER HALF A MILLION  JOBS WERE ADDED AND THE ARMED  FORCES WHERE SEVERAL HUNDRED  JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED.  >> Andrew: AND THAT CREATES A  GAPING HOLE IN THE WORKFORCE  ACROSS EVERY OTHER SECTOR.  >> THERE IS NO INDUSTRY LEFT IN  RUSSIA, WHICH IS NOT FUELLING  LABOUR SHORTAGES.  2.4% UNEMPLOYMENT MEANS THEY ARE ABOVE FULL EMPLOYMENT AND  BUSINESSES ARE HAVING A LOT OF  TROUBLE ATTRACTING OR RETAINING  LABOUR.  >> Andrew: CONSIDERING WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN LABOUR IS IN HIGH  DEMAND, WAGES GO UP.  MORE THAN 9% IN 2024, AND THAT  IS ON TOP OF 8% GROWTH IN 2023.  EVEN IF THE AVERAGE WAGE HAS  GONE UP, EVEN OUTPACING  INFLATION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO  UNDERSTAND THAT THE MONEY IS NOT BEING SPREAD OUT EVENLY.  IF YOU MAKE TANKS AND ROCKETS,  IT'S GOOD NEWS.  >> WAGES HAVE GONE UP BY A  FACTOR OF 5 SINCE THE BEGINNING  OF THE WAR.  >> Andrew: MILITARY SALARIES  HAVE GONE UP.  SOLDIERS ARE PAID SIGNING  BONUSES, THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS  EACH FOR GOING TO WAR.  >> RUSSIAN SOLDIERS FROM THE  FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW NEVER  HAD IT SO GOOD.  >> Andrew: AND EVEN IN DEATH,  THE FAMILIES OF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ARE PAID FOR THEIR LOSSES.  TWO RESEARCHERS ESTIMATED WHAT'S BEEN PROMISED TO THOSE FAMILIES  OF THOSE KILLED AND INJURED ADDS UP TO 6% OF RUSSIA'S BUDGET.  SAY YOU SELL CARS, YOU'RE A  TEACHER, OR YOU MAKE FURNITURE.  >> YOU'RE LOSING YOUR LABOUR  FORCE OR YOU ARE CRANKING UP  WAGES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  YOU ARE FACING A LIQUIDITY  CRISIS BECAUSE INTEREST RATES IS 21%, MEANING IT'S PROHIBITIVE TO BORROWING FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT  IN THAT SECTOR.  >> THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND  PENSIONERS BECAUSE STATES CAN  NOT COMPETE WITH THE CORPORATE  SECTOR ON WAGES.  >> FOR SOME PARTS OF THE  POPULATION, ESPECIALLY THE  POORER SEGMENTS, THOSE WHO WILL  BE AFFECTED BY INFLATION,  THEY'RE SEEING THEIR COST OF  LIVING RISE TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE  LEVEL.  >> Andrew: WHAT THIS ADDS UP TO  IS AN UNIMAGINABLE AMOUNT OF  MONEY BEING PUMPED INTO THE  ECONOMY, BUT DISTRIBUTED VERY  UNEVENLY.  [SPEAKING ALTERNATE LANGUAGE]. >> PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO NOTICE BECAUSE OF THE WAR, WHICH  REQUIRES MORE AND MORE  RESOURCES, HUMAN AND FINANCIAL,  PARTS OF RUSSIAN LIFE BECOMES  UNDER FINANCE.  >> Andrew: ADD TO THAT SANCTIONS FROM THE WEST, WHICH HAVE  ISOLATED AND RESTRICTED RUSSIA'S ECONOMY, SENDING THE VALUE OF  THE RUSSIAN RUBBLE TO NEW LOWS,  WHICH IN TURN IF YOU ARE A  RUSSIAN SPENDING RUBLES HAS MADE EVERYTHING IMPORTED MORE  EXPENSIVE, WHICH FURTHER DRIVES  UP PRICES.  NOW YOU SEE THE CHALLENGE THAT  RUSSIA'S ECONOMY FACES TODAY, AN ECONOMY TURBOCHARGED, BUT  IMMENSELY OFF BALANCE, INCHING  CLOSER TO A BREAKING POINT THAT  THE COUNTRY CAN'T SIMPLY GROW  ITS WAY OUT OF.  >> THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS  RUNNING EXTREMELY HOT.  VLADIMIR PUTIN MENTIONED IN  OCTOBER THAT RUSSIA NEEDS  ANOTHER MILLION WORKERS.  NOW, WHERE WILL THEY FIND THOSE? WHO KNOWS.  [♪♪♪] >> Andrew: THE FUNNY THING ABOUT INFLATION IS THAT IT'S ONLY  REALLY A PROBLEM WHEN YOU CAN'T  KEEP UP WITH IT.  IN RUSSIA RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A  SHRINKING NUMBER OF AVAILABLE  PEOPLE WHO CAN KEEP PUTIN'S WAR  MACHINE RUNNING.  DEPENDING ON THE ESTIMATES,  RUSSIA LOST SEVERAL HUNDRED  THOUSANDS, THREE-QUARTERS OF A  MILLION SOLDIERS, EITHER KILLED, INJURED, OR CAPTURED.  >> RUSSIA STARTED SENDING  INEXPERIENCED TROOPS.  >> ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE NEED TO  BE REPLACED, BUT RUSSIA'S LABOUR FORCE IS AT CAPACITY AND WE'RE  SEEING SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY IS STARTING TO BUCKLE.  THE PRICE OF OIL HAS FALLEN  SHARPLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL  MONTHS AND IS EXPECTED TO FALL  FURTHER STILL IN 2025.  G.D.P. GROWTH HAS BEEN  FORECASTED TO SLOW FROM A VERY  HEALTHY HIGH OF 4% THIS PAST  YEAR, TO LESS THAN HALF THAT  NEXT YEAR.  HAVING SLOW GROWTH, A SIGN OF A  WEAKENING ECONOMY, BUT HIGH  INFLATION, A SIGN OF AN  OVERHEATED ECONOMY, THAT'S THE  WORST OF BOTH WORLDS WHERE YOU  HAVE UNSUSTAINABLY HIGH PRICES  THAT EVENTUALLY FEWER AND FEWER  PEOPLE CAN AFFORD.  >> AS THE WAR CONTINUES, EVERY  MONTH IT CONTINUES, WE GET  CLOSER TO A POTENTIAL TIPPING  POINT OF ESSENTIALLY  HYPERINFLATION AND A COLLAPSE OF THE WARTIME ECONOMY.  >> Andrew: NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT NO ONE IS  SUGGESTING THAT RUSSIA'S ECONOMY WILL IMPLODE TOMORROW.  IT HAS DEEP POCKETS AND CAN  CONTINUE PUMPING MONEY INTO THE  ECONOMY WHILE TAXING THEIR  PEOPLE MORE AND MORE AS THEY  HAVE DONE.  IT CAN'T DO THAT FOREVER.  ONCE RUSSIA DIALS BACK THE WAR  MACHINE, IT MAY FIND THAT ITS  CIVILIAN ECONOMY HAS BECOME A  DEEPLY DAMAGED ECONOMY.  [♪♪♪", "duration(in seconds)": 599.0, "region": "US"}}

is wise comment question a lot of people are worried that AI is going to replace software Engineers so is coding still worth learning in 2024 well depends who you ask if you ask certain folks the ones who always seem miserable and say everything is going to collapse they will say no coding has no future but I've got a different take backed up by real world numbers in this video I'm sharing data that shows the continued demand for software Engineers so to understand where we are now and what the future will look like for software engineers make sure to watch this video to the end first I want to be transparent I've been creating coding courses for the past 10 years and in that time I've been lucky enough to teach millions of people how to code and launch their careers in Tech so yes you could say I have a vested interest in this field but I want to assure you that this isn't a sales pitch it's about helping you make make an informed decision I want you to hear both side of the story and decide for yourself what you believe at the end of the day it's your decision whether you want to learn coding or not and even if you want to you don't even have to buy my courses or learn from me there are thousands of great options out there so yeah there is a lot of fear about AI replacing coders headlines scream about robots taking over jobs and it can be overwhelming but the truth is AI is not going to take your job instead it's the person who knows how to work with AI that will steal your job the reality is software engineering is not going away at least not anytime soon don't just take my word for it here's some data to back it up the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics often called the BLS is a government agency that tracks job growth across the country on their website you can see that the employment for software developers is expected to grow by 26% from 2022 to 2031 the average across all occupations is 3% so that's a strong indication that software engineering is here to stay but it'll most likely transform and that's what we'll explore in this [Music] video to better understand the impact of AI on software engineering let's take a minute and talk about the history of programming in the early days of computing programmers wrote code in a way that only computers understood long strings of zeros and ones it was incredibly tedious they had to keep track of of exactly where each piece of data and code was stored in the computer's memory and to do that they had to manually calculate memory addresses and make sure that different parts of the program didn't override each other compilers came to solve this problem with a compiler we can program in a human readable language like C++ without worrying about how that code should eventually get converted to zeros and ones and where it will get stored in the memory that's the job of a compiler now here here's a fact compilers didn't replace programmers they made them more efficient and the result of that the amazing websites and apps we have today that no one could even imagine in the past these days billions of people can communicate in real time AI will likely do the same in the future we'll be able to delegate routine and repetitive coding tasks to AI so we can focus on complex problem solving design and Innovation this will allow us to build more sophisticated software that most people can't even imagine today but even then just because AI can generate code doesn't mean we can or we should delegate the entire coding aspect of software development to AI because AI generated code has a lower quality and humans still need to review and refine it before using it in production in fact there's a study to support this they collected 153 million change lines of code between January 2020 and December 2023 and they found disconcerting trends for maintenance ability and listen to their prediction for 2024 Cod churn which means the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than 2 weeks after being authored is projected to double in 2024 so yes we can produce more code in less time with AI but more doesn't equal better humans should always review and refine AI generated code for quality and security before deploying it to production and that means all the coding skills as software engineer currently has will continue to stay relevant in the future you will still need the knowledge of data structures algorithms programming languages and their tricky parts tools and Frameworks you still need to have all that knowledge to be able to review and refine the AI generated code you'll just spend less time typing it so anyone telling you that you can use natural language to build software without understanding anything about coding is out of touch with the reality of software engineering sure you can make a dummy app but not the kind of software that runs our banks Airlines Healthcare the kind of software our life depends on we can't let a Code Monkey talk to a chat bot in plain English and get that software built at least not anytime soon in the future we'll probably spend more time designing new features and products with AI instead of writing boilerplate code we'll likely delegate aspects of coding to AI but this doesn't mean we don't need to learn to code think of it like a skilled architect using blue prints the architect doesn't need to handra the whole blueprint themselves but they still need to understand those blueprints in detail make sure everything works as designed and give clear instructions for those building the final structure as a software engineer you'll always need to understand the code review what AI generates and refine it either by hand or by guiding the AI to improve also keep in mind that coding is only one part of a software engineer's job we often spend most of our time talking to people understanding requirements writing stories discussing software architecture and so on AI cannot help with that aspect of our work it can only boost our programming productivity but not necessarily the overall productivity in fact another study by McKenzie found that for highly complex tasks developers saw less than a 10% Improvement in their speed so as we can see here AI helped the most with documentation and code generation to some extent but moving on to refactoring the the Improvement dropped to 20% and for highly complex tasks it was less than 10% and this happens when the coding task involves something the developer isn't already familiar with so if anyone tells you that software Engineers will be obsolete in 5 years they're either ignorant or trying to sell you something in fact some argue that the role of software Engineers may become more valuable as they will be needed to develop manage and maintain these AI systems they need to understand all the complex of building software and use AI to boost their productivity now some are worried that one senior engineer can simply use Ai and replace many Engineers essentially leaving no job opportunities for juniors but again that's a fallacy because in reality the time savings you get from AI is not as great as you are promised anyone who has used AI to generate code knows that it takes effort to get the right prompts for usable results and the code still needs polishing so it's not like like one engineer will suddenly have so much free time to do the job of many people now you might say but MOS that's the current state of AI look AI is rapidly advancing and in a year or two it will be able to build software just like a human well in theory yes AI is advancing and one day it may even reach and surpass human intelligence but in theory theory and practice are the same in practice they're not the reality is while machines may be able to handle repetitive and routine tasks human creativity and expertise will still be necessary for developing complex Solutions and strategies I strongly believe software engineering is going to be extremely important over the next several decades I don't think it's going away but I do think it's going to change in the future we'll have to learn how to input the right prompt into our AI tools to get the expected result it's not an easy skill to develop it requires problem solving capability as well as knowledge of languages and tools so here's the bottom line if you have already made up your mind and don't want to invest your time in software engineering that's perfectly fine Follow Your Passion but if you like building things with code if the idea of shaping the future with technology gets you excited don't let negativity and fear hold your back software Powers our world and that won't change anytime soon yes the tools will evolve but the true skill lies in learning and adapting the future software engineer needs today's coding skills and an understanding of how to use AI effectively the output of AI is only as good as the instructions you give it think about it programmers must work directly with zeros and once today's web developers need to know HTML CSS Tailwind JavaScript typescript react nextjs git automated testing and so much more my prediction is that the future brings even more complexity demanding more knowledge and adaptability from software Engineers if you found this video helpful please give it a like And subscribe for more useful coding advice", "duration(in

South Korea's KF21 fighter jet project While Jakarta initially committed to funding 20% of the development costs financial delays reduced contributions and unfulfilled payments have hampered the collaboration In addition allegations of technology leaks involving Indonesian technicians have strained relations but South Korea continues to engage Jakarta in part because of Indonesia's status as an early export customer for the KF-21 Indonesia's previous collaboration with South Korea's DEU ship building and marine engineering on submarines has also been played by Gallay Jakarta's potential partnership with Turkey on submarine production could offer an opportunity for a restart Although its track record raises questions about the long-term commitment and implementation of the project Turkey's defense ministry recently announced significant progress on its ambitious naval projects including the national submarine the TF2000 air defense destroyer and the national aircraft carrier Defense cooperation between Indonesia and Turkey appears to be entering a new more strategic phase with a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial approach with both countries recognizing the need to expand cooperation beyond the sale of military equipment to joint production and technology transfer This move not only demonstrates Indonesia's seriousness in building its defense independence but also strengthens Turkeykey's position as a major player in the global defense industry President Mdogen in his statement emphasized that Turkey is ready to share knowledge and technology with friendly countries such as Indonesia especially in strategic projects such as fifth generation fighter jets and submarines He highlighted the importance of cooperation based on trust and shared geopolitical vision Turkey and Indonesia are two big countries that have the potential to shape a new defense order in this multipolar world Herdogan said Turkeykey's national fighter jet project the Khan is currently in the advanced stages of development with its first successful test flight taking place in early 2024 The aircraft is designed to replace the F-16 and is projected to be the backbone of the Turkish Air Force in the coming decade Indonesia's participation in this program although still in the negotiation stage has the potential to open up great opportunities in the development of high-tech capabilities in the aerospace sector For Indonesia participation in the Khan project is also an effort to secure alternative partners after the uncertainty that overshadowed its involvement in the KF-21 project with South Korea By joining the con program Indonesia can ensure access to cuttingedge fighter jet technology while developing local production capabilities through clearer and more structured technology transfer In addition to the aerospace sector the maritime sector is also a major focus in the strategic dialogue between the two countries Indonesia views Turkey as an ideal partner in the development and production of modern submarines Turkey has proven its capabilities by building the riceclass submarine and developing its own national submarine program The success of these projects makes Turkey a country that is not only capable of producing but also designing naval weapon systems independently Turkey is also developing a new type of submarine with stealth technology and more advanced underwater combat capabilities This technology is very interesting for Indonesia which has so far relied on submarines in collaboration with South Korea but has not yet achieved optimal results The problems of delays delivery and even limitations in technology transfer are important lessons for Jakarta to choose partners with a more solid track record Indonesia's desire to strengthen its underwater capabilities is not without reason Indonesia's strategic geographical position as an archipelagic country and located on international sea lanes requires a submarine fleet that is capable of maintaining sovereignty and ensuring the security of its territorial waters Through cooperation with Turkey Indonesia hopes to accelerate the realization of the Navy modernization program As a NATO country that is not only a user but also a developer of advanced weapon systems Turkey provides a guarantee of stability and certainty in long-term cooperation This is important for Indonesia which has so far been looking for strategic partners outside the west and east in building the independence of its defense industry If realized the partnership between Indonesia and Turkey has the potential to change the landscape of the defense industry in Asia and Eurasia This collaboration will also strengthen the bargaining position of both countries in the increasingly competitive and complex global geopolitical arena With the right synergy both can be successful examples for other developing countries that want to pursue independence in the field of defense technology This strategic step emphasizes that both Indonesia and Turkey do not want to be just consumers but also major players in the global defense industry By strengthening this cooperation both countries send a message that a new era has begun An era in which developing countries begin to determine their own security future", "duration(in seconds)": 496.0, "region": "US"}}

I hope you all are doing absolutely well. Guys, in this video we are going to see JNC technical assessment actual questions that were asked in the actual technical assessment. Okay, I will be showing you the questions also and I will be trying to explaining explain you the answers also related to those questions. Make sure to watch the video till complete end because you will get a lot of benefit by practicing these questions because sometimes the technical assessment uh questions get actually repeated or if not then the similar pattern exact similar pattern questions will come with just some data will be changed. Okay. So make sure to like watch it very carefully and if required you can also watch it twice if you have not understood in one go. Also I just want two things from you guys. If you are finding this content helpful, please write the word helpful so that I get to know how many of you are preparing for your examinations and I can post more such videos related to that. So, so before we start the video, if you new to my channel, make sure to subscribe to the channel as I regularly upload these kinds of helpful videos for all of you. Okay. So, now let's get started with today's topic. So guys, these are the questions that came in the assessment. Okay, these are the actual questions. Now since these images are not much readable what I have done is I have taken them in the written format so that we can read them clearly and we can solve them clearly so that it will give you a better practice of how you can also attempt the questions in the examination and what types of questions comes. So this will have a very good preparation of questions for all of you. So let's see the first question that we have which is based on SQL. So let's read the question first. Write an SQL query to display the user ID, first name and last name of the top five users who have sent the most messages along with the number of messages they have sent. The output should be sorted in descending order of user ID. Your output should contain the following four columns. User ID, first name, last name and message sent. You can view the database schema by clicking on view schema tab at the bottom of the query window or on the right side uh on the right hand side of the screen basically. So see guys I have also not just taken a question for all of you guys so that if you are if someone is not aware how to solve this question just I have taken a sample answer okay there can be multiple ways of writing this query but I have taken one such way okay I would not recommend you if you are already aware of how to solve this question then don't watch this solution of mine you yourself try to figure out okay how you can solve it but if you are not aware you can watch this solution so see what I have done here is I have used the select first I'll read out the query and then I'll try to explain you select u dot user user ID U dot first name U last name count M dot message id as message sent okay and uh from users u basically we are retrieving user id first name and last name from the users table okay and we count the number of messages sent by uh each user using this count okay and like this count we are like counting the number of messages sent by each user and allies its uh message sent okay then then what we are doing is we are joining the tables okay the message table contains message details and we use joins on users and messages where user uh like u dot user id is equals to m dot send id which means user dot user id is equal to messenger uh messages dot sender ID to fetch the messages sent by the uh like each user then what we are doing we are grouping the data so this basically this line that you'll see on line number four this this line is ensuring that the messages count is calculated per user okay and then what we are doing is we are sorting the data okay so for sorting we are using order by and uh it sorts the users by number of messages sent in descending order and this order by user uh id dc is applied to sort the users in descending order. Okay. And then we are limiting it to five which means limit five this is basically ensuring that the only the top five users with the highest messages counted are displayed. Okay. And then finally this will be our expected output like basically this expected output you won't have to see but uh yeah like what this query will generate and what the data that it will give this is the data that we will have okay the name of the employees their last name and user ids and then messages sent. I hope you have found it helpful guys if you have found it helpful please put the word helpful in the comment section because with that only I get to know that how many of you are preparing for the exam and I can post more videos related to that. Let's move on to the next question that we have. Again the next question is also based on a query only. Let's see what we have to do in this query. First let's read the question clearly. Write an SQL query to display first name, position and salary of staff members where salary is greater than 50,000. Use an allias for the first name column as staff first name. Your output should contain the following three columns that is staff first name, position and salary. You can view the database schema by clicking the view schema tab on the bottom of the query window on the right hand side of the screen. Let's see the query first of all and then I'll try to explain you again. And I would not suggest you to go with my solution. You try to create your own query because that will give you a practice of how can you solve these questions in the examination. So the query is select first name as staff first name position salary from staff where salary is greater than 50,000. So basically what we are doing is we are retrieving the first name and salary from the staff table. The column first name is allized as staff first name using s to match the required output format. Okay. And then what we are doing is we are filtering the data. That is what we are doing here is where salaries grading uh greater than 50,000. So this condition ensures that only staff members earning more than 50,000s are included and then we are outputting the things okay which means uh the query returns only the relevant details with properizing as required. So basically whatever the conditions that we need to set and this will be a uh expected output okay like uh the name and salary will be greater than uh 50,000 and then their positions. So this output displays the start staff members earning more than 50,000 with their first name as staff first name. Okay, I hope this is understandable and guys if you haven't subscribed to the channel yet, please do so because it takes a lot of hard work to create this kind of content for all of you. Okay, so if you respect the content that I'm providing, please make sure that you subscribe to the channel because that is only what you guys can do for me. Let's move on to the next question which is based on HTML CSS part which is UI based. Okay, the one UI based question that we get. Let's read the question clearly first and then I will give you the quick answers for this question. Okay, and I will also try to explain you. But again I would suggest you that you try to solve it on your own because watching my solutions will only make you understand this question but the other questions that you are going to attempt how you can get it right. So you have to be prepared enough so that in question exam when the question comes you can solve it on your own. Let's see the question that we have on our screen. You are working on an interactive animal display application that showcases adorable animal images and fun facts. While the basic structure is in place, it needs functionality to dynamically update images and facts based on the user selection, ensuring that the correct animal image and its fun fact are displayed whenever it's their respective button is clicked. The objective are add the ID animal fact to the paragraph element in HTML that displays the animal fact. Add a gap of 15 pixels in CSS to displays the button properly. Ensure that the puppy and kitten buttons display the correct animal image and fun fact when clicked by linking them to the appropriate functionality. constraint is do not modify any existing ids and class names. Keep all the existing styles and functionality intact. Okay, see guys, so don't focus much on this uh you know like JavaScript part because most of the things will be set up given to you already set up in the code. Okay, your main part is to set up the HTML part, CSS part and basics JavaScript whichever is required. Okay, so see uh first of all uh let's see this uh like code. Okay, you can see this code. Basically, this is for HTML part and this is like whatever like you know gap addition was required like uh 15 pixel and all. This is for that part. I'll quickly guide you through it. Okay. So, see you uh it was asked to add a ID right. So, we have added an ID animal fact here. Okay. And to the paragraph element in the HTML. This is basically ensuring that we can dynamically update the display fact. Okay. And then we are adding margin right of 15 pixels between the button for better UI alignment. Okay. And then we have linked the like event listeners to the puppy and the kitten buttons in the JavaScript part. Okay. And so that when the puppy is clicked, it updates the image to puppy. JPG and send the changes to puppies uh like whatever the thing is there. Okay. Like code or something the text basically. And when kitten is clicked, updates the image to kitten.jpg and the changes uh updates the fact to the kitten related fact. Okay. And what will be the expected output? Basically when the puppy button is clicked, the image will update image should update to the puppy image and then the fact should update the puppy fact. Okay. And when we click on the kitten button, the image should update to the kitten picture and then uh the fact should update related to the kitten. So basically this uh is how you have to write it. Basically for all of those who have basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, this is one of the easiest ones. And we have seen that the level of questions were very easy. It was not that tough if you have prepared well. So I would also say youth that please make sure that you prepare well for these because you know if you are already prepared well, you won't find it tough. And that is the main motive of me creating this videos so that you get a actual uh habit of or actual practice of questions that come in your assessment. Okay. So that's all for today guys.

"well it is an excellent fight card of course at the top we've got featherweights Vulcanoski versus Lopez for the vacant title lightweights Chandler and Pimble are going to clash in our co-main event we've got featherweights Mitchell versus Silva more featherweights with Rodriguez versus Patricio Pitull and we start the main card off with light heavyweights Krillof versus Reyes and with that now we welcome in Michael Chandler and Patty Pimplet the two gentlemen in our co-main event guys thanks so much for joining us excited to have you guys here michael I'm gonna start with you real quick question you know you're a guy who always puts on a show i love that Patty i love the flare uh you always put on a show Michael but you can't take a risk with a guy like Patty Pimble here so what's your approach in this fight oh man i'm just going to I've been doing this for so long i'm excited to go out there and put it on the line um people haven't seen it maybe but over the last couple years I've really uh put together some really good game plans there's some things that happened in the Charles Olivera fight um that really reminded me that I am becoming more and more of a veteran i think I'm still getting better so I'm excited to go out there and compete and my son Hap loves the double thumbs up i won't do it right now when we FaceTime because it does throw those fireworks up but that's exactly what this fight is going to be fireworks on April 12th excellent i love it and Patty look I just saw you in London i know how seriously you're taking this obviously beating a higher ranked guy is something for you but what is your main motivator in this one um obviously I'm want to come and take rank seven off Michael you know what I mean that's the motivation want to stop getting called a prospect and start getting called a contender so that that's the goal the goal is always to become world champion and obviously the extra motivation is me babies you know what I mean i've got to put food on the table for them and if I lose I won't be getting anywhere near as much so there's there's no such thing as losing we just come in to win and I I got a question for both of you guys is you know this is a fight where you're both going out there with something to prove and along the lines of what you just said Patty about the prospect both you guys seem to have doubters that just continue to linger for both of you what has that been like and why do you think that's the case for you in particular Patty um I don't know i think it's cuz I still look like a 16y old boy you know what I mean people look at me and like think look at the hair and think that I'm I'm not a fully grown man when I am now you know what I mean people think it to get in the cage with them and then when I get in the cage with them and they feel me strength and they feel me technique they they get a sudden real realization and for you Michael same thing you know you're a guy that's got to go out there and and prove yourself again and go out there against somebody like Patty but again the doubters continue to linger for both of you guys what do you think it is about your style or about you as a fighter that keeps the haters kind of floating around it's going to happen man i mean hey the sport of mixed martial arts it is a sport at the end of the day you got to focus on the X's and the O's and the wins and losses but when it comes to strength of schedule when it comes to a guy who came in and said what he was going to do and then do it fight the Mount Rushmore for first ballot hall of famers of the who's who of the lightweight division that has been my strength of schedule thus far but I'm not taking Patty lightly an absence of strength of schedule is not the presence of weakness i'm looking at Patty like he's the most dangerous guy who I could possibly face on April 12th uh even if he is self-proclaimed looks like a 16-year-old boy but he he doesn't fight like that um and we're going to go out and we're going to put on a show for the fans and Michael one more for you buddy uh just along the lines of how do you balance your desire to be as entertaining as you are and always have been with the desire to just get that much needed hand raise i'll tell you what I I've never looked at it like balance man since I was 14 years old I threw my entire self into hand-to-hand combat um I've never once hit the brakes i've never once slowed down i've never once taken no for an answer sometimes it gets me a win sometimes I take a loss um but I always pick myself back up and I get in these big fights now here we are co-main event five rounds Miami um I plan on coming to steal the show man and I'm I I'm excited to go out there mix it up with Patty i think he'll feel it right away in the first exchange i am like no other guy that he has fought in his past uh with that being said I'm going to go out there to fight to get my hand raised patty my first question is for you listen we Mike Chandler has had a long history of career of these crazy fights just memorable moments against some of the best fighters in the world and when you look at the straightforward style that he brings into the octagon what part of that style do you think plays into your favor in this fight um everything to be honest um other people who he's fought he's not wrong he's fought first balance all the famous lad know what I mean he's fought Pier he's fought Gi he's fought Charles all like the best lightweight in the division for the past five years but I think I'm I'm going to make it look easier than they did you know what I mean they play into Mike's style they stand there and brawl with him i think anywhere this fight goes I'm going to win to be honest the only way I lose here is if I get hit with a big crazy wild shot on the chin and as you all know scouters don't get knocked out so there's no way that's happening and my last question is for you Michael um like you said you have only fought first ballot Hall of Famers throughout your tenure here in the UFC but for every fight that you've had it's always seemed to be that on the other side of a big win could be a title fight now this fight is a lot different you're having to fight down in the rankings you're fighting the number 12 guy respectfully what is your motivation for taking this fight i think it's part of uh the life cycle of a fighter you know you continue to fight the top competition at all times continue to push yourself but at some point you've got to give a guy like Patty an opportunity to prove either he is who he says he is or he is not but I I plan on April 12th to prove who I am one of the best lightweights on on the planet um and Scousers don't get knocked out apparently but they've never been hit by the likes of me i'm really really excited to test his chin i'm excited to test his heart his metal the fans when you fight at the O2 go crazy you've got a storied history over there we've seen the crowds go nuts for you but what does it mean for you now to be in this moment here co-main event in Miami big big big show for you is this the arrival for you yeah this is what I've been waiting for you know what I mean um I'm in Miami now landed here last night i've had a couple of little walks around the streets and in the shops and all the people are greeting me and asking for photos and stuff like that so I know Mike lives in Miami where he trains in Miami don't know if he lives in Miami but I'll be honest I'm not I'm not the fighter here like some people go into the Lions then and get food i know everyone's going to be cheering for me when my when my song comes on and I walk out there's there's nothing like it i electrify the whole arena the amount of people what told me at UFC 304 in Manchester where it was I didn't walk out till about 4:30 5:00 a.m in the morning the amount of people what said to me I was falling asleep until you walked out and I woke the crowd back up that's that's what's going to happen as as Mike's just said we're going to steal the show whether it's a five round war or whether someone gets finished in the first two or three rounds we're going to set the crowd of light i know it's the best card of the year there's so many good fights on it but there's no way there's going to be a better fight than me versus Chalet all right well it sounds incredible real quickly Michael can you give us a prediction and then Patty I'll get yours man I'm going to go out there and I'm going to do exactly what I always do i'm going to have one foot on the gas one foot on Patty's throat i'm going to throw big bombs and we're going to see if he sinks or swims uh he's never fought a guy like I like I am um but that doesn't mean he's not the man for the job so we'll see how it plays out all I know is I'm getting my hand raised on Saturday night it's going to be a lot of fun and Patty you got a prediction um yeah i've said it before i've said it plenty of times in different interviews i think I'm going to finish Mike in two um as I say I think I can finish this fight anyway he loves lunging with his punches i can see me catching him with a shot on the way in putting him down or I can actually see me submitting can actually see me submitting i don't uh I don't see a way I lose to be honest i I really don't look at the size of those paws dude come on seen the size of these look at the size of those paws see the size of these but bird hands dude i think I think we're gonna we're gonna have a scrap on the feet to be honest i know I know Mike won't take me down i know he knows he'll be in for a world of trouble on the floor so I think we're going to have a scrap on the feet nice nice well all of us are looking forward to it so much guys co-main event at UFC 314 michael Chandler Patty Pimble thanks so much for joining us here on UFC Live [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 546.0,

bit more accessible and with time then you'll be able to do a modified plank on the ground or even maybe a full plank one day but we have to start somewhere so let's work into a little bit of a tutorial for a wall plank so you're just going to need about a foot of space or your shoulder distance is a part of free space on the wall and we'll go over some good form tips and I'll show you how to slowly progress the plank on the wall and then later on in time you'll bring it down to the floor but this is where we are going to start to build up that essential arm and core strength to hold a proper form feel good and stay safe most important so let's take it on over to the wall we're going to start with the beginner variation and then we'll Advance it in this wall plank so the easier very Asian is going to be your hands really open those fingers up plant them on the wall firmly I don't want to see any space between any part of the hand that's super important when we start to put more weight in the hands we want to make sure those wrists are safe so if the fingers are really light it's going to put more pressure in the wrist so I want you to open the hand up and push it into the wall like you're in kindergarten making those cement hand prints that's the idea of what you're doing right now arms are straight yeah I don't want to see too much of a bend in the elbows unless you're a hybrid extender and if you know that that is you then you are putting that little micro Bend right there in that elbow joint the next place we're gonna go is to those shoulders let's drop them down off of the neck which is really important as we get stronger in these planks that our shoulders are in the proper position okay guys so this is already challenging I want you to just stay right here but to increase the intensity with time or if you're ready today you walk your feet back so I start to become a little bit more of a diagonal line instead of that upright line in the spine from my head to my heels the next place I'm going to take you with the form is the back so it's super important that we are not pushing our butt back behind us you can see how I've really added to my curve and my low back and this is pinching the vertebra the spine right here and it doesn't feel good even demoing that but I want to give you a good visual so that you're like I will not do that I know better so what I want you to do is the complete opposite so you're going to tuck your hips under and slightly push them forward so you can see how that I've sent my tush and angled it more towards the floor that's what I want you to do here and that's giving me a reminder to pull my belly up and in okay so that's what I want to see in this lower back area Okay so the next space we're going to take it to add on to the challenge is onto your toes the heels are up now the ball of the feet are down so I'm not like on my Tippy Toe like that the ball of the foot is down like if you're wearing a high heel shoe or you're doing a calf raise so I'm definitely up to the Ante now I feel a lot more work in my arms and my core so that is why it's important that the hands aren't like this I'm really feeling it in the wrist important that the shoulders don't do this I feel it in my neck and important that my butt doesn't do that because I feel it in my low back and on my abs and we're here to get that core strength so we've got all of those form cues from here to make it a little bit more challenging the feet just continue to walk back potentially really close together if those legs are close together and far back that is going to be your most challenging variation here on the wall and if you're trying to progress your strength maybe you start with any of these I just showed you 10 seconds five seconds whatever's challenging but you feel safe doing and is it hurting any area of your body and then every time you come back to it I'd suggest at least three times a week if you really want to get a good strong plank every time you come back to it you're going to start to add time and distance so more seconds holding the plank maybe even got to admit and you start to add a couple more minutes onto that or further away from the wall so I'm just going to set this up from the beginning we started here and we walk it back eventually we end up on the toes we keep going back eventually we bring those legs to gather and that is going to be your more beginner modified plank into your more advanced Plank and then we're going to walk it in so guys I hope this wall playing tutorial was super helpful for you because I would love if you could do a plank one day and you feel really strong in it and this is an awesome place to start the wall is so so helpful for so many exercises so take advantage of it and I appreciate you for being here today please like subscribe and share and I will see you on the next tutorial or the next workout and I hope you have a fabulous day bye guys", "duration(in seconds)": 326.0, "region": "US"}}

Outlets reported that Iran has received the first batch of its purchased suco S35 fighter jets consisting of two Su 35s or S35 SE aircraft although these media Outlets did not provide specific details about the contract between Iran and Russia they noted that Iran and Russia have signed a 20-year Cooper op ation agreement that includes military collaboration based on this agreement it is speculated that Iran may have purchased a production and assembly line for either the suco S35 or suco s30 from Russia these media sources did not comment on other details such as the method of delivery or the Weaponry intended for these fighter jets however it is speculated that the Su 35s may be delivered to Iran in a manner similar to the yak 130 training combat jets with the assembly process carried out by both Russian and Iranian technicians within Iran according to Mr Kyle MO is in Iran is expected to receive a total of around 58 to 60 S35 fighter jets afterward Iran may consider purchasing fifth generation suco su-57 Fighters or joining the suco su75 project Mosen also mentioned that the first batch of su 35s has already been delivered to Iran and all of the Jets ordered from Russia are expected to be handed over to the Iranian Air Force in the near future these details indicate that Iran and Russia remain committed to the S35 deal and that the delivery pace of these Jets to Iran has accelerated this is seen as positive news for the Iranian Air Force especially given the current sensitive and critical circumstances Kyle moazen is one of Iran's most experienced International journalists a graduate of moscow's lomonosov Journal ISM University he has worked with news agencies such as irna turkey's trt Russia 1 and Sputnik recently he revealed significant information about the Iran Russia contract offering new details to the public although some of these claims such as the delivery of the first batch of S35 to Iran had already been reported by other Global media Outlets a lingering question has been whether Iran is prepared to accommodate the new Russian fighter jets for years Iran has been using aging Western and Eastern fighter jets with most of the Air Force's budget spent on overhauling and refurbishing these outdated aircraft this is a time-consuming and costly Endeavor making it challenging to establish the necessary infrastructure for operating new fourth generation Fighters domestically however with increased Financial Resources allocated to support the new Jets concerns about the lack of infrastructure Readiness for the Su 35s have diminished in recent years it appears that Iran has made progress in developing its airports and building the necessary infrastructure for new aircraft for example satellite images showing a S35 mockup at the Eagle 44 base and the construction of larger shelters at Shahed noj Airbase in hamedan suggest that the infrastructure is nearly ready for the arrival of the new Fighters according to the plans for finalizing the fighter jet purchase the process of construction and delivery will not begin until the Destin na country Iran is ready to receive the new Jets everything must proceed according to the plan schedule agreed upon by both sides the acquisition of 58 to 60 S35 Jets by Iran aims to create an integrated air defense network composed of Iranian groundbased systems such as the 15 cord and bavar 373 alongside the suco Su 35s and F14 Tomcats maintaining the the operational status of the f-14s is increasingly difficult but the addition of S35 could significantly enhance Iran's defense capabilities particularly in protecting its oil and nuclear facilities this measure significantly covers the existing air defense Gap in Iran although acquiring an awax Airborne warning and control system aircraft is also necessary to complete the defense ring given the current Financial conditions purchasing awax seems somewhat unlikely Additionally the S35 fighter jet can perform various roles in protecting the airspace including engaging awx and refueling tankers from long distances confronting enemy Fighters or completing the air defense ring to cover blind spots of course this is primarily the role of awax aircraft but due to the exorbitant cost of acquiring awax and Iran's Financial constraints the country could use the S35 in a mini awax role as as a temporary substitute naturally effectively countering fifth generation Fighters with a fourth generation jet is not feasible however not all of Iran's aerial threats come from fifth generation aircraft the backbone of the air forces of Iran's adversaries consists of fourth generation Fighters most of the current aerial threats Iran faces are posed by fourth generation aircraft such as the F15 Strike Eagle F-16 Viper typhoon and others although Iran has not officially announced when it finalized the S35 purchase agreement speculation that began in mid 2020 suggests that the negotiations might have taken place shortly before the lifting of arms embargos with the contract being finalized one or two years later the delivery timeline for the Jets to Iran is reportedly set for late 2024 or early 2025 in comparison to Egypt and China which were the main customers of this fighter jet Iran's contract process C is progressing relatively normally despite its political and Military tensions with Israel and the United States as well as the war in Ukraine for instance Egypt finalized its contract in late 2018 and Russia fulfilled the order 3 to four years later around 2021 or 2022 however the Egyptians refrained from accepting the Jets due to fears of us sanctions similarly when China officially finalized its S35 purchase from Russ R in 2015 it took 3 to 4 years for the contract to be completed notably the first batch of su 35s was delivered to China just one year after the contract was signed it is difficult to say whether the delivery of the Su 35s to Iran has been delayed due to the war in Ukraine as the exact date of the contract's finalization is unclear if Iran intends to fully rebuild its Air Force it will need between 140 and 204th and fifth generation Fighters along with a large number of awax transport and training aircraft this modernization effort could take place over a long period although the arrival of the suco Su 35s will significantly boost Iran's air power weaknesses will remain and some of the Aging Fighters will still be in service requiring replacement with newer Jets so far Iran has only officially acknowledged the purchase of a few Yak 130 training aircraft and around 64th generation S35 Fighters there is also a possibility that Iran May acquire some suco su30sm specialized training purposes which could also serve a limited offensive role however the acquisition of su30sm with certainty if you found this video informative don't forget to hit that like button share it with others interested in military Affairs And subscribe for more

raywilliamjohnson, colorado", "script": "so this woman is a conspiracy theorist and I don't know if she believes the Earth is flat or whatever but there's one conspiracy that's going to get her sent to prison for a long time let me explain now her name is Tina and she's a County Clerk and the person in charge of making sure every ballot in her county is counted during an election and one day the 2020 presidential election happens and unfortunately for Tina her favorite candidate doesn't win so because she's a conspiracy theorist she starts thinking the election was rigged and she's convinced it's some kind of deep state conspiracy so instead of reporting her suspicions to the county attorney Tina comes up with a shady plan to break into the voting machines in her County in order to prove her conspiracy however she can't just go in and access these machines alone there are all sorts of checks and balances in place and someone else with the passwords has to be there in person for it to work now there is an IT consultant who got dragged into this scheme and we'll just call him it guy and he has access to the machines but we'll get back to it guy so anyway Tina really wants to get into these voting machines and one day she gets a hold of it guy security badge and she gives that badge to another dude a dude we'll call conspiracy turd and so then Tina conspiracy turd and the deputy clerk this woman Belinda they they all three go to the election offices and conspiracy turd uses the security badge that they took from IT guy and he pretends to be there on official government business and they use that badge to access the passwords and suddenly they have access to the election systems hard drive so they get some screenshots of the data and they copy everything onto an external drive and by the way all of this is very illegal because it's election tampering but then allegedly conspiracy turd takes all this voting system data and he gives it to a bunch of other conspiracy turds and then a few months later some of that voting system data shows up on the Internet passwords videos images for the whole world to see now obviously voting machine data is information that shouldn't be public a big reason is because people can then use this information to then hack the voting machines so this is a very big deal and this sensitive information is now on the internet and pretty quickly someone alerts the secretary of state of Colorado so then the next day Boom the District Attorney's team goes to Tina's office to investigate and they of course find signs of a security breach and then bam the Secretary of State suspends Tina's position as County Clerk meanwhile the deputy clerk Belinda she's also suspended and barred from going into the office but Belinda sneaks back in to like print some documents or something and boom she gets caught and arrested Ed here's her mug shot so now Tina and Belinda are officially barred from supervising any elections because they knowingly took voting machine data and gave it to a bunch of conspiracy theorists but here's where the story gets out of control a few months later Belinda goes to trial and Tina shows up to support her and while Tina's sitting in court she pulls out her iPad and she starts recording and you can see her with the iPad here there she is is and there's the iPad now you're not allowed to video record a court proceeding especially when they specifically tell you not to so some people spot her recording and she gets caught and charged with contempt and the judge issues a search warrant for that iPad then the next day Tina goes to a local bagel shop and the police show up with a search warrant for that iPad and Tina she is just not going to cooperate so they handcuff her and she is not happy' let go of me you let go of me let go of me she even tries to kick the officers as they handcuff her and let's see that again in slow motion But ultimately they do get the iPad from her and they bring her outside and she fights them the whole way let go of me you're hurting me and I'm going to show all the bruises that you put on me if you're not going to cooperate you'll take char obstructing let go of me you understand that you let go of me now but Tina is still not going to cooperate go then stand up like an adult shut up what an thing to say to me what what an thing to say to me you are under arrest beinging me and anyway she eventually does get arrested here's her mug shot now after she's arrested and this video goes viral other conspiracy theorists who also think the president election was stolen they hear about this and they get so mad they call 911 in Tina County to express their outrage I want to talk to whoever the hell put those handcuffs on that nice woman I saw on the television I can't believe of a Colorado resident fiod and it's not just one angry 911 call it's so many calls that it jams the 911 lines what they did at Tina Peters today was outrageous when did they become a us so anyway Tina gets out of jail on Bond and it appears like she does everything in her power to control the narrative And Delay her trial for the election tampering like she fires her lawyers a bunch of times she tries to run for Secretary of State thinking maybe getting elected into public office will help her get out of all this but she doesn't win and this whole time she's still speaking publicly and insisting that the 2020 presidential election was rigged and that it's all part of some deep state conspiracy there's just a few of these people that are globalist that are marxists that are trying to take over our country and her continuing to spread this misinformation like this is a violation of her bond so then bam she gets arrested again here's another mug shot and she gets out on bail so she's free again but this woman is an absolute Menace remember it guy whose security badge she took and used to access the voting machines she starts trying to shift the blame off of her and on to him and she starts publicly throwing this poor guy under the bus he knew what was going to happen with his badge yes so then police they go and raid it guy's family's house and they confiscate all of his family phones and a bunch of their electronics and they end up getting a bunch of hate mail from random people and then months later the FBI raids his house a second time and they take the rest of their Electronics Tina is just out of control for blaming that guy is anyone going to stop her until at some point during all this Deputy clerk Belinda she gets smart and she decides to take a plea deal in the election tampering case and her deal involves agreeing to testify against Tina but Tina she's not worried about it at all I mean she's still out there talking trash speaking publicly about the case what do you think the chances are that you are in prison a year or two from now well I I'll tell you if I thought I was going to prison I would probably be on the beach somewhere so then after 3 years of Court delays the election tampering case finally goes to trial and of course Tina can't help herself she's got to speak up in court and she argues that she shouldn't be sent to prison for election tampering because one of the reason she gives is that she thinks she shouldn't be sent to prison because the prison beds aren't up to her standard I have health problems that would not be treatable in the Department of Corrections first of all I need a magnetic mattress but the judge he is just not having it and he lets her know that she is full of you are no hero you abused your position and you're a charlatan who used and is still using your prior position in office to Pedal a snake oil that's been proven to be junk time and time again so then Tina's found guilty and she's ultimately sentenced to 9 years in prison for election tampering and after all that I'm sure she still thinks she didn't do anything wrong", "duration(in seconds)": 510.0, "region": "US"}}

between the two superpowers keeps on rolling Elizabeth Economy is the senior adviser or was on China in the US State Department under Joe Biden's presidency Hello to you Elizabeth Hello It's good to be with you Thank you for coming and talking to us Elizabeth What what are your thoughts right now on the way that the the Trump administration is handling this policy with China including the changes of mind the changes of course by the president Yeah I mean I think um the president's administration is divided on how to approach China and I think that's reflected in uh the array of of uh the ratcheting up that we've seen um and the confusion around uh you know taking things off the tariff list saying oh I'm going to put them back on in another two days saying that the tariffs were initially about the fentanyl trade Uh I think he's been all over the map Um and I think that the the real issue here is what is the objective uh in terms of our trade with China I think the president came in said he wanted to do a big deal with China That was you know sort of what was anticipated Uh he began with tariffs I think in large part uh to gain some what he thought would be leverage But China didn't play ball the way that he thought that China would and you know they reciprocated with their own tariffs Um and now we're back in this you know tit fortat tariff war I think the challenge is that there are some in the administration that really do want to see a deal with China Uh and I think it's reasonable uh that we uh you know talk to China about the sort of unfair uh trading practices that they have the uneven playing field that they create for multinationals Um but at the same time I think there are other people in the administration that would be happy if the US and Chinese economies decouple And I think there's a third group that's interested really just in isolating China And I think you see the difference in the way the US has dealt with China as opposed to uh all the other countries that put the tariffs on So Elizabeth what is your best guess your best calculation of what is in the president's mind Do you think he maybe just misread the willingness of China to trade blows on tariff without backing down I think he absolutely misread the situation I think there was an assessment in the White House an incorrect assessment in the White House that the Chinese economy was struggling which is true but that this would be enough to bring Xiinping uh to his knees That and the fact that seemingly the Chinese economy is much more dependent on the US economy than vice versa given the in terms of the you know the level of exports um uh you know China exports much more to the US and the US exports to China What the administration didn't really consider was that we have a greater uh sole dependence on China for what it exports to us than China does for US exports Meaning that China can find many other sources of supply for its US for the uh what it imports from the US We have a hard time for about a third of the products that we import from China finding additional suppliers So it was a big uh mistake It was a big gamble and now we're paying the price I wonder if the the clearest sign of a miscalculation is the fact that uh that China is now halting the supply of those rare earth minerals which are so vital to high techch products including in defense A absolutely and I think you know we should have anticipated this you know beginning in the Biden administration China really developed a much more robust retaliatory toolkit uh you know for the kinds of export controls and tariffs that the US was placing on China We saw that they had they they already started um you know putting uh controls licensing controls on rare earths They went after individual US uh companies They put US companies on an entity list So it wasn't just responding with tariffs They have a whole array of tools at their disposal And I think this is a very significant blow And how do you how do you gauge the the capacity of China to ride out this storm and absorb the hits from falling demand from America I mean it's it's painful for sure and and certainly companies that um you know operate with low margins and apparel and toys and consumer electronics um all of them will be feeling the pain There is no market like the US market for these kinds of goods Um however uh we've also seen that that Xiinping has managed to transform what had been I think unhappiness with the way that the Chinese people were looking at their own government you know the owns their own problematic economy Now all of that negative uh you know attitude is directed at the United States I think Xiinping we provided Xinping essentially with a scapegoat for what really were the economic ills that his policies uh had engendered in the Chinese economy So I think at this point you have a much more nationalistic response you have a Chinese you know populace that is ready to do battle with uh the United States to demonstrate their resilience and I think to ride through what is going to be a painful uh transition if these tariffs stick They're estimating you know a 1 to 2% hit to China's GDP So it is consequential All right Elizabeth economy from advisor to President Biden Thank you So I'll go ahead First part the tariffs are necessary because we've been treated very unfairly by many many countries including our friends friend and foe but we've been treated very unfairly uh in trade uh at levels that nobody's really ever seen before And especially under the Biden administration they really took advantage of the United States Uh I put massive tariffs on China during my four years We had the best economy in the history of our country one probably the best economy maybe the best economy in the history of the world and I had I used tariffs to even things up and in particular with China we took in hundreds of billions of dollars and we had no inflation and it's a myth it's a myth that's put out there by foreign countries that really don't like paying tariffs and especially to even up so we've been treated badly by a lot we're using tariffs and I find and uh You just have to look at the numbers But I find that it's not about inflation It's about fairness And the inflation uh for us has not existed And I don't think it's going to exist We're going to bring our car industry back We're going to bring our chips back We're going to bring uh so many things back to our country including pharmaceuticals and drugs Uh and the thing that's going to get us there is tariffs And I say often it's my favorite word in the dictionary but I always preface that by saying now because I got into a lot of trouble with the fake news where they say uh that's not good So I say God love family wife they're all my favorite words but tariff is about number four or five on the list Uh but I will tell you uh it's going to make our country rich and it's going to stop us from being a laughingstock all over the world because we have been taken advantage of like no country has ever been taken advantage of Thank you very much And uh the one I told

the Titanic was sunk on purpose or that the government is hiding evidence of alien encounters in Roswell these are just a few of the many conspiracy theories that have captivated millions of people around the world but why do people believe in them even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary let's dive into the psychology behind conspiracy theories and explore the mechanisms that make these beliefs so compelling one of the main reasons people believe in conspiracy theories is due to cognitive biases the way our brains naturally process information often leading us astray confirmation bias it is when people focus on information that supports their existing beliefs and ignore evidence to the contrary if someone is already suspicious of the government they might only seek out information that confirms their distrust reinforcing the conspiracy theory pattern recognition humans are hardwired to seek patterns even where none exist our brains are constantly scanning the environment for connections this is why conspiracy theories often appear convincing they present seemingly unrelated events as part of a hidden sinister plan elucory correlation this happens when people perceive a relationship between two unrelated events for example after a global disaster people may claim that the event was orchestrated or that it serves a hidden agenda even if there's no logical connection conspiracy theories also offer something that's incredibly appealing certainty life can feel chaotic and unpredictable and conspiracy theories provide a simple organized narrative to make sense of complex situations control in an unpredictable world when people face uncertainty they often seek explanations that give them control conspiracies offer a sense of order even if that order is based on a fictional narrative for example during times of crisis like pandemics or economic downturns conspiracies provide a way to blame someone for what's happening offering comfort that events are not just random and uncontrollable reducing anxiety believing in conspiracies can reduce anxiety by replacing chaos with a clear predictable enemy this can be empowering for someone who feels helpless or powerless in their own [Music] life people don't form conspiracy beliefs in isolation our social environment plays a huge role in shaping these beliefs group identity humans have a strong need to belong people who believe in conspiracies often find themselves in communities that reinforce those beliefs these communities provide a sense of social identity where believers see themselves as part of an exclusive group that knows the truth setting them apart from the rest of society echochambers on social media and other platforms conspiracy theories can spread rapidly because of echo chambers spaces where people only hear information that aligns with their beliefs these environments reinforce ideas and make them harder to challenge further solidifying the belief in the conspiracy conspiracy theories often thrive in environments where trust in authority is low when people feel alienated or distrustful of institutions like the government media or science they are more likely to entertain alternative explanations paranoia and distrust some people feel that the official story is being manipulated or hidden by powerful figures this leads to a general distrust of institutions and fuels the belief that those in power are hiding the truth from the public historical precedents in some cases past events like government cover-ups or corporate scandals can further validate these feelings for example events like the Watergate scandal or the release of documents showing misinformation about tobacco and cancer can make people more inclined to believe that current stories are similarly false or misleading one of the most powerful aspects of conspiracy theories is their ability to offer simplified explanations for complex events black and white thinking conspiracies reduce complex situations to a clear-cut us versus them narrative where everything is either good or evil this simplicity is comforting as it eliminates ambiguity and uncertainty giving people a clear view of the world cognitive closure some individuals crave cognitive closure the desire to make a decision or arrive at an answer even if that answer is incomplete or false conspiracy theories satisfy this need by providing a simple definitive explanation for confusing or chaotic events why conspiracy theories are so hard to let go of the reinforcement of belief once a person believes in a conspiracy theory it becomes incredibly difficult to change their mind even when presented with contrary evidence this is due to the self-reinforcing nature of these beliefs cognitive dissonance when faced with evidence that contradicts a conspiracy theory the brain experiences cognitive dissonance the uncomfortable feeling of holding two conflicting beliefs to resolve this discomfort people often double down on their beliefs dismissing contrary evidence as part of the conspiracy another phenomenon at play is the backfire effect where attempting to disprove a conspiracy theory actually strengthens belief in it the more you try to refute the theory the more the believer feels that they're being targeted by the establishment reinforcing their distrust so what can we do about conspiracy theories understanding the psychology behind them is a start promote critical thinking it's important to encourage critical thinking teaching people to question their beliefs examine evidence from multiple sources and seek out reliable information build trust in institutions addressing the root cause of distrust in authority and fostering trust in public institutions can help combat the rise of conspiratorial thinking engage with empathy finally when interacting with someone who believes in a conspiracy theory it's crucial to approach the conversation with empathy arguing or mocking won't change minds but having an open respectful dialogue can help people reassess their beliefs conspiracy theories are a powerful testament to the way our brains seek patterns certainty and control by understanding the psychological drivers behind them we can better navigate the complex world of information and help prevent the spread of misinformation what do you think have you ever encountered a conspiracy theory that seemed convincing let me know in the comments below", "duration(in seconds)": 453.0, "region": "US"}}

This is the\nstory of how I learned how to code\nwithin four months, and I got a job. I did it with no computer science\ndegree or a coding BootCamp I am going to explain\nexactly what I learned, how I got\na job, and how much that job paid. Let's go. Before\nI got into tech, I was working\na lot of dead end sales jobs, because I dropped\nout of community college and\nI didn't really have any other skills. I didn't like the\nidea of always having to hop from\njob to job If I didn't like something. I wanted something with a little\nbit more career mobility long term. I didn't\neven really know what coding was. I just\nknew that the tech industry was,\nlet's say, a great environment for $180 grand now $200 ish $250,000 $400,000 annually growth... Yeah. By the way, I'm not knocking sales. I think sales\nis a really important skill to learn. I just needed a change, and it\nreally just wasn't for me long term. And I wanted to gain the ability\nto build something of my own. The idea of building\nsomething from zero to one\nseemed like a superpower to me. Day one, I just went on\nGoogle and I typed in how to code. That's when I found a site called\nFreeCodeCamp, and I started\nto learn about web development. I quickly learned about HTML, CSS, and I learned\nabout my first real programming\nlanguage called JavaScript. There's\na bunch of different programming\nlanguages that you could learn, but I personally\nchose JavaScript because\nI wanted to build web apps. Even\nmajor companies like Uber and\nAirbnb use it, and there's a massive\ndemand for it in the job market. By using FreeCodeCamp, I started\nto learn the basics of coding. I learned things like variables,\nloops, objects, and functions. But even after\ndoing the tutorials, I didn't really\nfeel like I could apply to anything. And I still didn't\neven know how to do something\nas basic as building a website. And I realized that I learned how to\ncode, not exactly how to program. I was writing\ncode to solve logic problems,\nbut I didn't know how to program, which is using\nthe code to build something useful. At this point, though, already\nI was starting to love the journey. I really liked problem solving,\nand I could see myself doing\nsomething like this long term. So\nI did what any sane person would\ndo and I quit my job and I moved\nto Korea to minimize my expenses. And I decided to learn full time. Learning full time\nwas a lot harder than I thought. I've\nactually never studied anything\nthis complicated or tough before, and I was quickly starting\nto realize that I didn't really\nknow how to study at this pace. I would sit in front of my computer\nand hours and hours would go by. That was when I went\nonline, I typed in how to learn. And\nI found a course called \"Learning\nhow to Learn\" by Barbara Oakley. This course was life changing. My two main\ntakeaways were one, it taught me\nhow to learn in space segments,\nA technique called Pomodoros. And the course\ntaught me that I needed to create\na dedicated space for learning. So I joined a Coworking\nspace, so I could focus better. Now,\narmed with new knowledge, I got\nback to studying. And it worked. Here's\nwhat a normal day looked like. 08:00 a.m wake up. 8:30, Head to the train station. 09:00\na.m. Arrive at the coworking space. 9:15, Coffee Journaling\nreviewing the curriculum. 9:30 to 12:30,\nI would have my first study session, where I did 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros. From 12:30\nto 1:30, I would eat lunch and take a\nsmall break, then back to studying. From\n02:00 p.m to 6:30, it was more 30\nminutes increments of Pomodoros\nuntil I was ready to head out. From 6:30 to 7:30,\nI would gym three times a week, And then 8:30\nto 9:00, I would eat dinner with\nmy grandma, then help her clean. This was my schedule\nfor six days a week, no exceptions. The next part of FreeCodeCamp\nwas a lot more challenging. Front end projects. They essentially give you a list\nof projects that you have to build\nusing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To me, this felt like\na massive jump because I never\nactually built anything before. I felt stuck at this stage\nuntil I found a YouTube channel\nof this guy named Stephen who would stream himself\nbuilding these projects line by line. By copying him\nand recreating what he was doing, I was able to\nuse that experience and build the\nnext couple of projects on my own. I also found a great resource\ncalled watchandcode.com,\nwhere you watch and code. By following along once again\nand modeling others, the concepts\nreally started to take hold, and I was really starting\nto understand what I was doing,\nnot just solving a math problem. In exactly one month, I ended\nup earning my FreeCodeCamp\nFront End Developer certificate. I was\nlearning a lot, but I never actually\nbuilt anything full stack before. Something with a\nfront end or an interface, the thing\nthat you see within the browser. A database where all\nthe information lives, essentially, and a server\nwhich handles and manipulates\nall the data in the back end by taking\nin requests from the front end. So I still felt like an\nimposter and not a real developer. You're not an intellectual.\nYou're a fake and a fraud. So to\nbecome a programmer, I decided\nto build my first full stack project. Remember\nStephen with a YouTube channel? I reached out to him\nto get his assistance to help me\nbuild my first full stack web app, we decided\nto meet three times a week. Here's what we did. We picked one\nmajor overarching project which\nwill teach me the basics of CRUD, which\nis Create, read, update and delete. These are the foundations\nfor any web application. I decided to clone Pinterest. I honestly don't think\nI would have gotten a job without\nthis next part, so pay attention. I asked Stephen\nto treat me like a real junior\ndeveloper working at a company. We implemented a project\nmanagement tool called Jira. We used\nJira to compartmentalize the entire\nproject and write the requirements\nof exactly what I'd be building. This taught\nme how to estimate my work\nand plan how to build an entire\nweb app from zero to launch. We also set\nthe project up on GitHub, which\nis a version control application. This taught me how to develop\ndifferent branches for when\nI was working on certain features, and I could learn how to control\ndifferent versions of the code. Most tech companies use some\nversion of the two applications because being a developer isn't\njust about knowing how to code. It's about knowing\nhow to work collaboratively\nwith other people as well. Stephen grilled me on\nour pair of programming sessions. He was\nvery strict about me keeping the\ndeadlines and the estimates that\nI originally wrote out for myself. He would constantly question\nwhy I was doing what I was doing. And\nhe even taught me the concept\nof DRY, just Don't Repeat Yourself, or essentially\njust making reusable code. I had to learn how\nto build by Googling for answers\nand using sites like Stack Overflow. And he\nwould leave me a lot of comments\non things that I needed to change. So I learned\nhow to debug my code on my own. This made\nme feel like I was a real developer. at this time, I supplemented\nmy learning journey with\nUdemy courses on React and Node because these\nwere the two frameworks that\nI chose to build my Pinterest clone. As a result of building\nmy first full stack project, I ended\nup learning how to do things like how to design a database, build\nAPIs, set up Auth, and eventually\npush the app to a cloud server. These\nare all things I would have never\nlearned by just doing tutorials. And\nin around two months, I finished\nmy first full-stack web app. I remember when I finished the\napp, I felt like a real programmer. That's when reality\nset in and I realized I'm still broke. I haven't made a single\npenny in over a couple of months,\nand I still needed to find a job. It was time\nto see if everything that I learned\nwas actually worth anything. First,\nI defined the job that I wanted. I wanted to be remote. And most\nimportantly, I wanted to work for\na small to medium sized company, because I hate working\nin a corporate environment. I found\nall the jobs that fit my parameters\non sites like weworkremotly.com\nand remoteok.io And instead\nof just applying to these jobs, I found\nthe contact information of the\nhiring managers and developers\nwho worked at the company, and I messaged\nthem to introduce myself. I explained\nexactly what I had learned up until\nthis point,what I was looking for. I even included\nthe link to my GitHub so they could\nsee the projects that I had built. Most importantly,\nI included an offer that\nI know that they couldn't refuse. I offered to work for free. And I understand\nguys, not everyone can afford to do\nthis, but I had originally estimated that this was going to take\nme around four months anyways. And I had\nanother month of time that I could\nessentially dedicate to learning. I knew all I had to do\nwas get my foot into a company,I\ncould essentially learn there and then prove\nmy worth over time to leverage\nthat into a real job long term. Overall, I found around\n22 jobs I thought fit the parameters\nof what I was looking for. I got\naround six responses. From those\nresponses, I got four interviews. And out\nof the four interviews, I ended up\ngetting three legitimate job offers. Even\nthough I had offered to work for\nfree, after the technical interviews, the employers thought that I had\nenough skills at that point where I\nwas worth hiring for a full time job. I ended up choosing the company\nwith the best opportunity to learn, and that\nalso happened to have the best\ncompensation package as well. My first salary was $50,000 a year, and\nthen after my probationary period,\nI was making $65,000 a year. My benefits\nkicked in like health and dental. But the\nbiggest perk for me was that I got\nto work remotely the entire time as\nlong as I worked the US time zone. I'm\nnot saying that you'll be an expert\ndeveloper if you follow this plan. I'm just sharing what I did to\nlearn just enough to land me a job, as\nmost of the progress that I've had\nas a developer all came on the job. No luck here, just focused effort. Now, I've been\nworking in tech for over a decade, and let me\nbe the first to tell you that nobody\ncares about your credentials. Learning\nhow to code was mainly two things learning how to solve problems,\nand two, persisting until you find\nthe answer that you're looking for.

And also, if you want\nto see me apply these principles\nto something other than coding, like something\nartistic, click on this video. Where we're going to put it?

the channel So I've got quite a few different intros that I place to the channel I'm always creating or tweaking with them because I like to create things right but one of them that I like to use quite a lot for various reasons which I'll explain shortly is the uh the one with Karma in it right now It seems to cause a lot of people grief and discomfort when they're listening to his voice And I understand why But for those that haven't heard it here it is Oh and don't skip it All right it's important Just listen to it all the way through This happened by design not accident Policies were reformed deliberately to liberalize immigration Brexit was used for that purpose to turn Britain into a one-nation experiment in open borders Now a lot of people have asked me of whether that's fake whether it's made up whether it's AI No it's not I have the speech I played it a few times on different videos He did actually say that that there was a group of people behind the scenes basically selling off the UK and opening up the borders He didn't mention who they were Of course he wouldn't would he the reason that I keep showing it and the reason that I'll keep showing it in the future is because I thought it was important When I heard it it felt important It felt like something I should save something I should hang on to and show people And for good reason because it's one of the very first breadcrumbs that leads us down the path of who is doing this to the country Well we've got our first smoking gun Have a listen to this As I've said many times for a party like the Conservatives just to open the door and say \"Come on in.\" If all you see is a sea of white Christian faces you need to see people from your own communities getting to the top of the army getting to the top of the legal profession getting to the top of the business and yes getting to the top of the Conservative Party and politics too So the truth is if we're going to build that strong vibrant and inclusive society we need more role models like this Many more Muslim men and women at the top in British businesses many more Muslim soldiers in the highest level of and of course more Muslims in our club So there's not just one Muslim in the cabinet and one in the shadow cabinet but British Muslims all across government in positions of leadership and authority In position positions leadership and authority Now I think that's as close as you're going to get to some kind of conspiratorial plot to destroy a country to hand it over to a different outside force because I'm sorry he's obviously not talking about Englishmen is he so he's going to hand this out to some some sort of outside force that is as close to an act of treason ever caught on camera Am I right and this is why we're seeing the country change so quickly We're seeing everything change so quickly The laws are getting skewed against the native British We're creating new rights and privileges for people that don't even belong here that have no right to be in this country And we never allowed in We never said it was okay We never voted for it We've been absolutely completely ignored this entire time It's a bit weird Well it turns out that they'd already decided guys there was no vote needed Who needs democracy when you can just get bought wow So it turns out that we're not crazy after all And this giant conspiracy about replacing power and privilege and certainly demographics eventually isn't just a conspiracy that we were right because our eyes were not lying to us this whole time Isn't it strange how our parliament and government starts to look very different all of a sudden the most Muslim MPs in all of Europe we proudly say Although it causes our streets to look like this Green Street London at 4:00 a.m after Chand Rot And it's not just the government either that's doing this Obviously you've got the government telling you that you're a piece of and that you're a racist an Islamophobe if you even notice what they're on video admitting openly But if you notice it or talking about talk about it you're a bad guy Now we've also got businessmen We've got the sellouts We've got the traitors We've got the rats the cockroaches people like this They will be the business people They will be the employers They will be the employees They will be the fabric of this town and of this county And I appreciate that very much And if you hadn't made the decision to come here and rear your families here we would have been denied the right of having those children in this county So I really think that is so important because the the more people that we can have the better and they're very nice and very respectful and I believe they will play an integral part of our community in the years and years ahead So in your society you might have a business owner who you think is a nice guy but it turns out he's a dirty little traitor like that man Or he could be a nice genuine patriotic hero like this man We are at Camelot Castle And here is John Mappin Hello Hello John How are you nice to meet you Good Good to meet you too Yeah We're going to get a tour of the castle You are Can I just say a very very warm welcome to Camp [Music] Castle Actually I was just about to finish the video when I thought I played this before Maybe it will help Just remember guys they're on record now This is the first evidence that we're going to see coming out proving basically that those in power those elected elected were supposedly in the interest of the British people and the British nation Turned out it couldn't have been further from the truth Now how many people how many deals have been made how many conversations like this go on behind closed doors i don't trust them anymore I don't want to vote for them anymore You can tell me to vote for a certain color and put my allegiance in a party like we saw recently that doesn't mean anything That could that party can just be bought up by a Muslim and then suddenly everything changes and all the people that built that party are kicked out Now we need something different guys I don't think we're going to vote our way out of this one Let's see The following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States It read \"When certain obstructionists become too irritating label them as fascist or Nazi or

google free ai coder, new ai coder free, new free ai coder, cursor alternative, bolt alternative", "script": "[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video so I recently covered Gemini code assist which was actually kind of cool because it's free and it has pretty good limits I mean getting above the 180k requests per month is almost impossible and the auto completions that I have been getting with it are kind of great as well I prefer it over the original co-pilot Auto completion although they have also leveled up a bit with their new GPT 4 o mini based autocomplete but this is also not bad and I really like it it obviously doesn't have the next edit suggestion and stuff but I don't actually care about it one thing that it really lacks is the one and only option of a gentic mode like it has the chat interface but it feels like it was built in the 1900s and isn't that great so I thought that I'll show you how you can have a great agentic chat setup alongside Gemini Cod assist and make Gemini code Assist work just like an autocomplete while you can use the free API of Gemini 2.0 to make it work on Klein or rode and have an agentic coder that does the main stuff for you now many people would say that Gemini is not as good as 3 7 Sonet or 03 and yes they are correct and it's not as good but you'll have to consider that this is free and it is quite usable especially if you set it up correctly like with 2.0 flash thinking as a planner and then 2.0 pro as the editor then it can even be amazing to use now let me just show you how you can do that and how you can configure all this but before we do that I want to take a quick break to tell you about Dart AI which is something that's been a game changer for my workflow lately it's an AI powered project management tool that's honestly quite amazing you can generate entire project plans from a simple prompt detect duplicate tasks automatically create subtasks and this is the coolest part you can actually assign tasks to the A itself and it will complete them for you you can use it to generate blog posts research topics and even create thumbnails without having to do the work yourself it's pretty insane how good it is the best part it's completely free for teams up to four people if you need more they have $8 and $12 plans with even more features Dart also has some great integration you can connect it with GitHub to link issues and PRS integrate with slack and Discord for updates and even use their API to build custom workflows if you're working on projects of any kind you should really give Dart a try it's built from the ground up with AI in mind and it shows in how seamlessly everything works check out the link in the description to get started it's free so you've got nothing to lose and trust me it'll change how you manage your projects now back to the video so first of all in VSS code you'll need to go to extensions and here you can just go ahead and search for Gemini code assist and get it installed and set up accordingly and it will start the autocomplete stuff and it works well and is pretty fast so this is great and you you can use this as much as you want as the rate limits are quite good here and the completions are also good if you don't like it then you can also give super Maven and kodam a try as well anyway now comes the main part which is to set up Klein or rode with Gemini now Klein and rode are generally the same but rode has more advanced features while Klein doesn't I'll recommend you to to just use Klein as it is simple to use and doesn't have a steep learning curve so just get that installed and then we can just go ahead and in the settings we can just set up our API you'll need to select Gemini here and then you'll need to enter the API key accordingly the pro flash and flash thinking models are free with some rate limits which are pretty fine for most of the stuff anyway now there are actually two modes in Klein first is the plan mode and the other is the edit mode plan mode generally only creates plans and then you can change to edit mode and get that plan implemented so I'll recommend you to set up flash thinking as the plan model and pro model as the edit one you can do that by just selecting the mode here and then setting the model accordingly which is kind of cool so just get that set up accordingly now let me just show you how all this comes together when you're actually coding so this is an app that I use for testing it is an image Cropper and brightness and properties changer thing now I want to add an option to it that allows me to change the highlights and shadows now first we'll select the plan option here because we want to first use the flash thing thinking model to work on a plan and how to achieve this so as we do that you'll see that flash thinking will start working on it flash is actually quite fast I mean even if you use 3.7 on it then it is slow at times and also sometimes just reject stuff because of their API downage anyway we now have the plan here which looks kind of great so now to make it apply the changes we can just change the mode to act and it will automatically start to apply the plan and edit the files accordingly pro has some higher rate limits than flash but it's better at coding it's also quite fast in comparison to things like sonnet anyway if we wait a bit then it's now done you can see that it did the code edits pretty well and the only thing that remains is to test it so let's just run it and once we do that you'll see that here's the app and if we use it then this works pretty well so this is amazing to see I mean considering that it's free it's actually quite cool if you combine flash thinking and pro then you can get some quite amazing results for free which is kind of amazing you can also use the Gemini code assist for autocomplete and this will be like a full Gemini setup and I actually really like it because their apis are actually quite reliable and you can use it quite easily with their free tier which is kind of great another thing is that you can also set up mCP servers for some other stuff as well and integrate Gemini with that as it will allow you to customize to your own workflow like you can add the obsidian mCP tool if you use that or you can also add the super base one and stuff like that also there are some programming languages that Gemini works best with like react Python and stuff it also works amazingly with go and flutter so you can use that as well anyway go ahead and give it a try for sure and it surely helps if you don't want to use sonnet and others overall it's pretty cool anyway share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel you can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks I'll see you in the next video bye [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 525.0, "region": "US"}}

So far, the dollar has jumped,\nwhile currencies of major exporters like the Mexican peso and Japanese\nyen have slumped. On top of that,\nTrump has literally said that. under my leadership,\nwe are going to take other countries jobs. Did you ever hear that expression before? So does this mean that Trump's plans will enrich the US\nand make the rest of us poorer? That is the question we'll be going over\nfor each of these two key economic policies,\nstarting with the one Donald Trump has been obsessing over since the 1980s. Trade policy where, while Trump\nused to obsess over Japan, the United States has now been overtaken by China\nas the world's most important producer. But crucially, as you can see here,\nwhen it comes to being the most important source of demand, the US is still\nthe world's most important importer. Indeed, as you can see here in this graph\nfrom the IMF, almost all of the surpluses\nfrom systemic export to countries like China, Japan, Gulf states and Germany are absorbed by demand\nfrom the United States, which is represented by the dark orange\nbars. Therefore, continued demand from\nthe United States is crucial to the global economy and especially for systemic\nexporters like China, Japan, and Germany. Ever since Trump first came to power\nin 2016, the US has been trying to desperately decrease\nits imports and increase its exports. Trump did this by imposing tariffs\non the world and especially China. On the other hand, Biden\npreferred to dole out subsidies to U.S. based manufacturers while keeping in place\nand even increasing some Trump tariffs against China. So what can the world\nexpect from Trump now? First of all, Trump\nis likely to cut Biden's signature subsidies,\nespecially to green energy producers. The world's\nexporters will be happy about that, but they will hate the fact\nthat tariffs are now back on the menu. Tariffs against China. But crucially, also against any country\nthat displeases Mr. Trump. And which country displeases\nTrump the most? Well, it's mostly countries\nthat run a big trade deficit with the US, but notably countries can get in Trump's good graces\nif they buy a lot of military equipment from the US, or if they do a lot of NATO\nspending, we're leaving the US elsewhere. This is why trade surplus countries\nlike Saudi Arabia and Israel managed to stay in Trump's good graces, while\nMexico, Germany and Japan and of course, China were consistently under threat\nof increased tariffs last time around. Surprisingly, though,\neven these exporters could still end up exporting more to the United States\nunder Trump, not less. You see, while tariffs\nwill likely hurt exports to the US, last time around, Trump\nturned out to be a big spender, slashing taxes for most Americans\nand giving them stimulus checks. This made Americans richer, allowing them\nto spend a lot of that on more imports. Therefore, despite his rhetoric,\nthe trade deficit doubled under Trump the last time. So will Trump again\nbe a paper tiger threatening with tariffs while implementing tax cuts\nthat increase US demand for global goods? I think that now, for a large part\ndepends on Trump's billionaire friend Elon Musk, Who Trump promised will had the newly formed Department\nof Government Efficiency. This agency will be charged with sweeping\nspending cuts, spending cuts that could be so drastic that\nthey will plunge the US into recession. At least\nthat is what Musk has hinted at on X. If the US ends up in a recession,\nits citizens will of course have far fewer dollars\nto spend on imports. In that case, Trump 2.0 could actually be\na disaster for the global economy. So, will Trump again be a big spender. Or will Trump and his new buddy\nElon crash global markets? So far, our financial markets are betting\nthat Elon's spending cuts plans will be more like his failed\nVegas tunnel than his SpaceX X rockets. As the mighty US dollar shot up right after it became clear\nthat Trump won the election. This likely happened\nbecause currency traders were betting that Trump will spend more\nbecause the inflation, and this then, will cause the Federal Reserve to raise\ninterest rates to counter that inflation. Then higher interest rates\nwill attract more foreign capital to U.S. markets, causing the dollar to rise. This is the second key effect Trump's\nspending will have on the global economy, which relies heavily\non borrowing and lending in US dollars. So while increased spending on the one\nhand may help the global economy, this will partially be offset by the fact\nthat the fed will have to raise rates, which will make global dollar\nborrowing and spending more costly. This will especially hurt\nglobal dollar borrowers like Egypt, Turkey and Argentina,\neven though it may help global lenders like China, Japan, Germany. On the other hand, if the island scenario\nhappens and global trade crashes, we can expect the Federal Reserve to partially offset\nthis by lowering interest rates. Instead. So in. Conclusion Trump having won means that the global economy faces\ntwo fairly extreme scenarios. The first scenario is the Trump 1.0 boom\nscenario, with higher US imports and higher interest rates benefiting exporters\ndespite the threat of tariffs. The second scenario is\nthe Elon Musk austerity scenario, which will lead to lower trade and lower\ninterest rates ruining exporters while potentially providing some relief\nfor global borrowers. Right now, financial markets\nbelieve the Trump 1.0 boom scenario with higher US spending, inflation\nand interest rates is the most likely. I personally would not bet money on it\nthough, as Milei in Argentina has shown that the radical right wing spending cuts\ndo sometimes actually materialize, leading to a recession One thing is certain, though, and that is\nthat this type of radical uncertainty is bad news for the long term\nattractiveness of the US dollar as a global reserve currency,\nand for global trade in general. That being said, as this graph has shown, global\ntrade has been unbalanced for decades now. Key Trump economic advisor Scott Bessant\nrecently said that the US under Trump does actually not want to abandon the global economic order, but rather\nreform it to make it less imbalanced. Indeed, many well-respected economists\nhave argued that the current dollar based economic order is ultimately unsustainable\nand leads to increased inequality within both major exporters\nand major importers. At least that was a major part of Mr. Besson's argument that he published in The\nEconomist, the sponsor of today's video. If you want to get into more depth about what the Trump\nadministration will do on a global scale, I highly recommend you check out the full\narticle in The Economist. Then I suggest you follow up with this\narticle published by a Trump aide, Nadia Shetler,\nabout how Europe can best work with Trump. Finally, I'd recommend this article about the tail risk of the new Trump\nadministration. Such extensive coverage of arguments\nfrom both sides is exactly why I'm excited to share that many macro viewers can now\nget 20% off an annual subscription to The Economist,\nwhich gives you full access to their daily, in-depth global\nreporting for an entire year.

part of the K-pop Conspiracy Theory series many of you left suggestions in the comment section so I decided to make a video featuring some of the ones you suggested without further Ado let's dive into some more conspiracy theories aware that these are all just theories and we should not take anything as a fact [Music] whenever the topic of iconic visuals is brought up Yuna is one name that will always come up the center of Girls Generation left her Mark in K-pop being possibly the most popular female Idol of her generation in South Korea part of that comes from her quintessential Korean beauty Yuna captivated the country being considered by many the personification of the Korean beauty standard for fitting 100% of the criteria but there's some people who believe that the Incarnation of the KBS could have foreign Roots it all started many years ago thanks to a blind item for the ones unfamiliar a blind item is a news story that reveals details about a situation but doesn't identify the celebrities involved the blind item in question said that a very famous girl group member who was believed to be fully South Korean was actually half Vietnamese but her company was doing everything they could to hide it the blind item claimed that the idol was of Vietnamese descent on her mother's side people who believed it linked the idal to Yuna for the following reasons Korean Vietnamese couples are quite common marriages between South Korean men and Vietnamese women began to rise in the 1990s from 1997 to 2020 around 120,000 such marriages took place the increase in these marriages was partly fueled by the growth of the commercial marriage brokerage industry the mystery surrounding her mother yuna's parents divorced when she was still a child and she was raised just by her father to this day we know nothing about her mother or her maternal side of the family so the theory suggests that her mom could be living in Vietnam or that SM Entertainment could be hiding her identity Yuna loves Vietnamese culture she has mentioned several times that her favorite type of food is Vietnamese her members always choose Vietnamese cuisine when it comes to her she has shown that she even knows how to cook it impressing fans with how professional she looked doing it she has also visited Vietnam frequently including twice in 2014 for Cal exchanges childhood pictures unlike a lot of Idols Yuna has no pre-debut picture of her wearing a traditional Korean outfit which is pretty normal but there's one picture of her as a baby where she is wearing an outfit that resembles traditional Vietnamese clothing way before Yuna SM had already debuted Idols who come from a mix of nationalities but a big part of the appeal surrounding Yuna was her being this pure Korean beauty so learning that she has Vietnamese descent could have led to a lot of discrimination towards her and shattered the Illusion for the audience potentially preventing her from achieving such a high level of popularity and affection the theory has sparked doubt even among fans who have been following Yuna for years especially because they know that sm's pretty good at hiding information that they don't want [Music] out if you were into Power pop music around 2007 you most probably heard the song Jenny from the North American band and The Click Five the song is about a girl named Jenny who sends mixed signals to her partner making him uncertain about the relationship's Direction when the song first came out people wanted to know who was Jenny one of the songwriters Ben Romans was asked about it during an interview and answered Jenny is just a name a name that scans well in songs it's more a representation of anyone being fickle if you're wondering what this song has to do with K-pop well 9 years after its release a fan Theory started gaining a lot of traction within the community after connecting the dots people came to the conclusion that the Jenny that The Click Five had been singing about for all these years could be none other than K-pop icon Park bomb and here are the reasons why bombb in the front man of the click 5 Kyle Patrick were both students of the Berkeley College of Music in Boston during the late 2000s in the music video Jenny is played by an Asian actress which was pretty rare for an American rock band at the time Park bomb's American name is Jenny park with the same spelling as the title of the song although Kyle Patrick was not a part of the writing of Jenny the number of coincidences has led many fans to believe that bomb could still have been an inspiration for the hit after being bombarded with questions following the buzz of the theory Kyle Patrick tweeted we may never know the [Music] truth whether it's their birthday or debut anniversary we often see Idols celebrating a special date accompanied by a cake in the last few years several of them went viral for dropping or somehow ruining their [Music] cakes over time fans began to get weirded out as it just continued to happen to the point where there were compilation videos showing the same thing happening to various Idols after the phenomenon started gaining attention fans began to bring up old videos of the same thing happening years ago due to how often this has occurred a theory emerged suggesting that this is not just a weird coincidence the theory claims that the cakes are actually made to trick the audience and try to hide the fact that Idols are put on Extreme diets even during celebratory occasions is a well-known fact that K-pop companies put their artists under very strict diets which already caused controversy several times over the years so a lot of people believe that companies don't allow their artists to eat cake in order to avoid weight gain and tell them to ruin the the cakes and pretend it was an accident leading fans to believe that the reason they aren't eating is because they spoiled it and not because they're not allowed to have [Music] it I know this video turned out a bit short that's because I'm working on bigger projects that will be out soon and because I'm trying to create a schedule for my channel but I

time in Japan but he watched all of the pride events back in the day and he never thought he'd be here a dream come true [Music] five and one three of those victories coming inside the distance for Amir aliakbari the superlative wrestler 10 minutes five minutes two round match no head batting no airbow striking elbowed to the Head are not permitted in This heavyweight attraction and unlike the first heavyweight fight of the night let's hope that these two heavyweights go at it like Wendy's and Hardies onal media the beef is in the rising ring what do you look for early Frank well I mean to me it's whoever lands the first strike I think aliakbar is probably a better Striker looks a little more balanced and centered or better Striker when it comes to this game I think uh it's going to be a grappling match body shots in the clinch KN to the body by Los Santos and this is uh the position aliakbar wants to be a Greco Roman wrestler the go behind Wast lock by aliakbari and of course we saw what he did against he hering now into cross-side position the side control on Jano dos Santos dos Santos has lost seven times via submission aliakbari has three knockout wins no submissions yet he's being crucified right now well that's dos Santos in the crucifix position ground and pound by alak body and this is bad position for dos Santos early in the fight I didn't tell he's got no answer for it hard part about this position is you start really putting energies into it you start really getting nervous because you can't move your arm you can't move your your position at all you start making silly escapes and wasting a lot of energy you have a cool story about one of Dos Santos or excuse me aliak bari's coaches Mike swick former military member contacted you back in the day back in the day used to be in Afghanistan used to Rite me from the dirt tell me he was going to be a fighter wanted to come to these states and uh train him train him for years got him started AKA San Jose of course you were part of the founding members there with Javier Mendes crazy Bob cook and of course uh want to congratulate Daniel Cormier on successfully defending the UFC light heavyweight championship DCA great ambassador to the sport no matter what the fans think got to embrace that heel Persona he's got to embrace the heel persona like him he's the nicest guy it's so funny certain people uh people don't like what a formidable Force he was at heavyweight in Strike Force remember the grand beating Josh Barnett no slow throwing a body slaming do Santos meanwhile peppering Amir or excuse me being peppered by Amir aliakbari who has him in this crucifix position now look at this choke yeah sliding this in forearm choke say what's funny is I bet you he wishes he had elbows now that 30 lb weight uh advantage in his disfavor but he can sure use some elbows right here he is just trapped there that arm is just tied up alak bar holding the other shoulder is grounded pound from the crucifix and Amir aliakbari vanquishes Jano do Santos to improve to six and one four wins via form of [Music] ko I'm here I'm here [Music] up came down to position alari had all the positions and just kept one just stayed there crucified worked it out these are these are solid solid shots that was a need to stop fight Santos just no understanding of how to escape out of this position first round techical knockout the winner that's a big scary match bounces back from the lost to Miracle kroop aliakbari best jono dos Santos viia TKO team photo so 10 fights in the books one more coming your way in this the first Rising MMA event of the year as we begin the year-long celebration the 20th anniversary of the spiritual wealth or father of rising Pride Fighting [Music] championships the

to learn coding, learn how to code, software engineering, fireship, bigboxSWE", "script": "I used to think it wasn't worth it to learn how to code until I realized that there are pieces of code out there that make more money per minute than I ever will in my lifetime in fact I can bet you that in the time you took to brush your teeth this morning somewhere out there some piece of code triggered a program to sell a few stock options and make some unknown Wall Street investment firm a couple million USD in profit the truth is if you know how to code you can run laps around everyone else that doesn't and if you learn how to use AI to help you you can run even faster apps but one thing is for sure you actually have to sit down and learn how to code luckily I'm going to save you from having to sift through all the over complicated advice on the internet written by first year computer science students who took one intro to CS course and then went on to buy this MacBook this hoodie these headphones these laptop stickers this coffee mug and this iPhone to take late night pictures of their vs code setup of course with only one line inside the actual code editor step one instead of listening to them just start because it's a well-known fact that 100% of successful programmers have at some point started crazy isn't it if you have no money to start out and you want to learn Slowly by yourself over a long period of time I recommend this free website called Road m.sh it's the first thing that comes up when you Google coding roadmap for pretty much every technology role you can think of like front end backend full stack cyber security and for pretty much every Niche skill like system design API design and AWS you get a solid road map which you can use to at least start learning but if you're more of a structured learner who learns better with a solid curriculum assignments and support you could get a degree or you could jump into a boot camp nowadays a lot of companies don't really care if you have a degree as long as you're good at building stuff and you have experience and by the way if you want a more affordable and reliable path to a high-paying flexible Tech job that doesn't take up four years of your life and a huge stent loan you would especially benefit from this video sponsor triple 10 triple 10 helps literally anyone even complete beginners gain all the necessary skills to get placed into a high-paying Tech job you can pick from software engineering data science cyber security and a bunch more but the reason why I recommend them is because they give you externship opportunities they give you project experience tutors coaches code reviews and career help stuff that the average self-taught learner doesn't have access to and I'm not saying the job market is bad but this this is what the average computer science student looks like nowadays after graduating once they realize that 14 minutes of studying per week probably wasn't enough so when I see that 87% of triple 10 grads get hired within 6 months of completion that's enough to convince me that something is working here you can get a tech education and actually have a job to show for it you can do the whole thing online remotely on your own time even if you have a busy schedule and on top of that they guarantee that if you won't find a job within 10 months of finishing the course you'll get 100% of your your money back plus if you use the code easy you'll get 30% off on all of their courses and can save up to $3,400 on your education so don't hesitate to click the link in the description or scan the QR code for a free career consultation but anyway let's go back to looking at the softop road map whatever you do do not obsess over mastering a programming language programming languages are pretty easy to learn and once you know one language it doesn't take a whole lot of effort to learn other ones some are strongly typed meaning you have to bench press at least 200 lb to use them other languages are weakly typed like JavaScript because weak people use it sometimes the syntax is different some languages have faster performance in certain use cases some languages are easier for beginners some languages are used by only one company and meant to be run on a specific type of machine some languages shouldn't exist some languages are low-level meaning they're harder for humans to understand but easier for machines to read and other languages are high level meaning they're easy for hum to understand but they give you a little bit less control over the actual machine but yeah just just Learn Python you'll notice that the road maps they give you are pretty long and pretty detailed but I'm going to be honest no actual developer needs to have deep knowledge about all of these topics and you shouldn't try to do everything on the road map that's like trying to learn how to make grilled cheese by reading a book on bread and a separate book on cheese at some point it's just faster to make the thing and see what happens experience is what you need need but the nice thing about this website is that it always gives you somewhere to start No Nonsense no fluff no filler no watching thousands of videos called if I wanted to be a software engineer in 2079 here's what I would know all you need to do is start on the road map learn some of the stuff in the Yellow Boxes maybe take a course or two and read a couple articles and watch a couple videos and then immediately move on to step two make stuff think to yourself how can I use what I just learned to make something that I actually want to make for example if you're a beginner in web development and you really like pressure washing driveways then guess what you can make a website where a user can input how big their driveway is the surface type and where they live and it'll estimate how much they would have to pay to get a pressure washed it sounds simple but I guarantee you it'll be way more complicated than you expect you'll have to look up pretty much everything and you will 100% be tempted to give up halfway through when your eyes are getting dry your posture is deteriorating into free form shapes and the backs of your thighs are sticking to your chair but ask anyone who's actually Gotten Good at coding and they'll tell you once you can get that first project done you have now ascended from what's known as tutorial hell into the far superior project Heaven which is where all the accomplished developers live and breathe just look at neil. fun this collection of little mini games was made by a college student practicing coding and if you look at the first couple of websites he made many years ago they're pretty basic something a beginner can make in a few days but when you look at the newer ones it's pretty easy to tell that coding skills got a little bit more advanced and you can do the exact same thing as long as you put in the time and don't give up even when business school starts to look real tempting one big reason you might feel disappointed in yourself when you first start learning to code is because everyone else seems to know way more than you and they talk about Concepts you don't even know exist as if they're common sense sometimes you'll hear your favorite coding YouTubers talking about API calls and weird systems and acronyms and Niche Technologies and protocols that just make no sense because none of those things show up in an 8 Hour python for beginners YouTube tutorial and although it may seem like some people were born knowing how to set up servers and backend databases and websockets and how to create Bots out of thin air it's really just a gradual learning process that takes a long time you probably won't learn the stuff in school you probably won't see it in textbooks and probably won't get recommended on your YouTube homepage but you will learn it through projects and Googling and reading people's code and copying and pasting other people's code until you've created a fully functional final product you won't become a programming experts logging through 11-hour YouTube tutorials back to back to back at the same time one big issue is that everyone tells you to just build projects you're passionate about but what if you're not passionate about anything what if you're just coding to pay the bills and your only hobby is watching YouTube luckily there's an easy solution hover over the top left menu of this website and click on projects based on whatever language you know or whatever skill you're trying to practice they have actual useful projects that you can test your skills with and the best part is that they give you General guidelines on what to make how to put your project on GitHub and where to find help but unlike most places they don't just give you the solution unlike a YouTube tutorial where you're just watching someone build a project and then copying down every single line of code one by one this forces you to actually learn and if you can't find a good project on this website don't overthink it just start just do Google Search and pick whatever sounds the most fun by now you may be thinking if tutorial hell is step one and Project based Heaven is step two then what's step three lead code limbo if you don't know lead code is a website where you can practice staring at a computer screen with a coding problem and not understanding anything for weeks in a row unless you're applying to a company where you're the firstborn child of the CEO you're going to have to accept that leak code is law when you're applying to a top tech company being good at solving leak Cod problems is like a secret handshake between you and your interviewer there's a secret handshake that exists in all companies they want you to be able to jump through a set of Hoops to show that you are good enough to be there and so we don't have like a really good way to gauge how good someone actually is at coding in 20 minutes 30 minutes 50 minutes so instead it's like hey you come in here I'm going to do that secret handshake you better have done 300 leak code problems you've done 300 leak code problems you walk in you know how to use a map sets uh you understand trees we just know that you can do all the things now is it the best way to test people probably not there's no best way to grind lead code you can find many road maps for lead code online and ideally you would space it out over at least a few months instead of trying to do 75 problems in a week but the important thing is you just have to do it it might be intimidating to see people on YouTube coding up solutions to lead code hards before you've even finished reading the problem but it's important to know that everyone once started but solving two some in oent squared and if all else fails you can just tell yourself McDonald's is the new meta anyway if that helped I'm collecting

trip just to go to a Sears we should go the one in Puerto Rico we should bring Tony bring Tony that'd be amazing first of all Puerto Ricans were not upset by I mean I'm sure some were but like my friends are like I'm still voting for Trump Puerto Ricans can take a joke they are some of the best [ __ ] talkers on Earth abolutely it's it's common in Puerto Rican communities just have fun and joke absolutely it's not a super sensitive neighborhood super sensitive um ethnic group no but most people didn't care they're like I don't care it was a stupid thinging to do it there but it turned him into a legend As Long As Trump won if Trump didn't win we were gonna have to hide him for real yeah I was going to hide him I was goingon to move him to Thailand or something to Thailand yeah he's got to get out of the United States for a while for how long though a while depending on how bad sideways things go if KL haris becomes president the Deep State take over and they completely censor all social media remove everybody's guns Force vaccinations on all your babies everybody gets a sex change who knows he's just in Thailand and he's in Thailand with lady boys just drinking his life away because you can't believe he [ __ ] it up for one shitty laugh he could go live in Puerto Rico you know there were stories that were uh ready to be published if Trump lost blaming it on Tony that's crazy yeah yeah blaming it on that one joke in Mass Square Garden where the facts is and Tony will tell you actually Puerto Ricans voted 26% more for Trump which is true they probably did than ever before yeah well people were [ __ ] fed up people were fed up didn't vote none of this makes any sense I mean I think honestly most people right now their main concern is like they can't even afford groceries exactly so they're like whoever I think is going to help me with that well listen I don't know what is true or not true but like people who were like I can't afford to feed my kids it is so crazy I was watching this guy on MSNBC and he was dismissing that in terms of like when people think a certain way like people have like a partic if they're a leftist or if they're a fundamentalist Christian they they have one thing in common and the thing that they have in common is they want everyone to think like them sure and this guy was saying that about like young people listening to podcasts and they're getting air quotes radicalized and that um we need something that can do this uh from a feminist perspective okay and teach young men feminism the the whole thing was so strange but one of the things that he said that was the most strange he said instead of like these minor grievances like the price of eggs or someone is teaching you some your kids something in history that you don't agree with instead of those minor thing like what's major then man food for for kids food for your family history and and history well you know he said something you don't agree with like what I don't know what that means but education is primary it's one of the most important things for kids you got for the view of the world they have to be correctly informed it really helps if you have a good education and then if you have food if you can afford eggs that really [ __ ] helps and this so this idea that these are minor issues and the important issue is connecting men to feminism listen you can do that if you want but like most people right now are like I can't afford to pay for groceries for my kids I don't even have kids but like people are like I can't afford to buy groceries people who are making more money now are like I can't save any money yes everything's more expensive people are [ __ ] out of touch I'm clearly out of touch clearly but I remember when I was poor I understand it I really do and I know what the [ __ ] is going on and I know people are saying hey this isn't a minor deal this is like one of the biggest deals are you guys [ __ ] up the economy and you're gaslighting everybody and telling everybody you didn't you guys have spent billions of dollars on a war that nobody agrees with hundreds of billions and you're gaslighting us yeah I just also like these teachers that are just like spending all their own money for supplies for it's like what are you doing crazy why do teachers not have supplies for kids and you're right they are the future generation so if they don't have food and they don't have they're not like being instructed in you know learning stuff and you have these schools where there's so many kids to one teacher the United States is is like someone who owes you money and they say they don't have it and they keep buying cars right that's what it's like kind it's like how did you have the money to spend all this money on another country when you don't have any money to spend on the education of kids I mean homelessness the veterans let's just pick Let's just pick education like how much could they fix education with $175 billion you shouldn't have a teacher that needs to buy supplies right and imagine this imagine if companies were incentivized like what if they got govern grants based on how well the kids performed in the school districts great yeah like literally make it like halberton for schools like you know halberton they blew up Iraq halberton comes in and cleans everything up have something that profits off these places getting better and the better they do in terms of dropping in crime uh education rates graduation rates college rates everybody gets more money figure that out figure that out I mean they just want more money for prisons they do that too that's true if you don't send spend education then you could just have these people have to turn to crime and put them in prisons and that's how you'll get money there's a bunch of things they did in the 80s that still [ __ ] with us today and that's one of them that's a big one then the 80s must have been so wild because there's no computers and it's just like TV in the newspaper and everyone's running wild and Reagan's the president so nobody thinks anything's real get a [ __ ] movie star as the President JFK is dead nobody still understands that one wasn't Reagan's was Reagan's wife the one that was called the throw goat allegedly yes give her her flowers I think she is the throw goat I mean you could bestow that upon someone to B smirk their memory you could do that it's hard to say is that necessarily a bad thing but also the kind of G that can capture up a president probably knows how to get things done yeah yeah that's not necessarily A Bad Thing good for her I think it's a good thing yeah it's a I mean every guy would agree sure yeah it's a good skill for a lady to have", "duration(in

(cheerful music) Money is an invitation\nto critical thinking. You can afford anything,\nbut not everything. So if there's something that you value, whether it's travel, food, or a house, you can have that thing. You just can't have an\nendless series of ands. You might not be able to have\nthat thing and something else and something else and something else. And that doesn't just apply to your money. That applies to your time, your focus, your energy, your attention\n- any limited resource. And life is the ultimate limited resource. So when you practice being\nbetter at managing your money, you practice being better\nat managing your life. My name is Paula Pant. I am the host of the\n\"Afford Anything Podcast.\" I want to help you reach\nfinancial independence by making smarter\ndecisions with your money. (contemplative music) The mistake that I see\na lot of people make when they start asking questions about how to manage their money is that oftentimes people\nwill ask a question about a product or a tactic. So for example, they might say, \"Should I use this app, or should I invest in cryptocurrency?\" First-principles thinking\nis stripping away everything and really getting to\nthe root of something. So if you think about a tree, the tactics and the products\nare like the leaves of a tree. That's the most visible surface so, of course, it's what\npeople might ask about first. But first, let's start with\nthe roots of that tree. The roots of that tree are your values. It's that question of what matters most. And then from those roots\nstem that trunk of the tree, which is your philosophy of life, the type of life that you want to lead. And from that philosophy, then your objective or your goals: How does that philosophy of living translate into specific goals? That's really that tree trunk. From there, you go out into\nthe branches of the tree, and they represent the strategy. Now that you know your\nphilosophy of living, you know your goals, now you\ncan come up with strategies for how to obtain those goals. And then once you have\nthat strategy in place, then those leaves are the\ntactics and the products. So if you're starting with the question about tactic or product,\nyou've got a leaf in your hand, but you don't have that\nroot system built yet. When personal finance is framed in the context of delayed gratification so that you can have more\nmoney when you're 75 years old, it's really hard to\nget excited about that. But when we reframe that\nas financial independence and how taking better care of your money leads to this flourishing of freedom, of opportunity, of choice, that becomes much more enticing. FI is the point at which your\npotential passive income - money that comes to you\nwhen you're sleeping, typically through investments - is enough to cover your basic bills. And the reason that matters is because then endless\noptions open up for you. You have the freedom to\ndo whatever you want - whether that's to stay in\nyour current profession, make a midlife career change,\nbecome a full-time parent, or travel the world. Whatever\nchoice you want to make, you're able to make that\nwithout having to sweat about how you're gonna keep the lights on, how you're gonna keep the fridge stocked. The pursuit of FI is for everyone, but the first steps that you\nare going to take will differ depending on where you\nare in your journey. There are really only three steps to achieving financial independence: Grow the gap, invest the gap, repeat. Grow the gap means to grow the gap between what you earn and what you spend. And there are only two\nways to increase that gap: earn more or spend less or both. If you don't make very much, like me when I was in my\nfirst job out of college making $21,000 a year, at that stage of life, your\ngoal is to increase your income. If you're already making big dollars but you have a spending problem, the low-hanging fruit is to\ncurb that spending problem and to address the root\npsychological issues that are leading to that spending problem. Step two is to then invest that gap. My personal feeling is\nthat everyone should aim to save and invest at\nleast 20% of their income. And when I say save and invest, that includes making additional payments towards the debt above and\nbeyond the minimum required, retirement savings, investments\nin an investment account. It includes building\nup your emergency fund. Start with the goal of saving 20%, and if you're nowhere close to that, increase your savings rate by 1% and do that every month or two. It will take a few years, but you will over time\nget to that 20% mark. And then step three is repeat. This is a lifetime practice. This is not a quick hit or something that's going\nto happen overnight. Money management happens for life. (contemplative music) There has never been a point in history when the world has not been volatile. A hundred years ago, there\nwas also a pandemic going on, and there was a first World War. A decade later, the Great Depression. After that was World War II. After that, event after event after event that affected the entire globe. I came to FI because I was scared and anxious about the volatility\nin my life and the world. My response to that was to become obsessed with saving as much as I could because it allowed me to not\nbe so scared of the future. It felt psychologically\ncomforting to have these savings. Change is the nature of the\nworld, the nature of time. And so, if you're looking\nout at the big global factors that are happening in the world today and you're feeling fear, embrace it and use that\nfear as motivation, as fuel to make wise decisions about how you spend your\nmoney, your time, your effort. That's how you build a life\nthat's more intentional. And there's a lot of joy in that. (cheerful music) - [Narrator] Get smarter\nfaster with videos from the world's biggest thinkers.

for a lot of Gadgets in our lives because Tech changes fast products come and go and this is my annual video where I go over the tech products that failed flopped and lost funding this year some of it is a little sad but some things you will be glad to see gone hey did you know that you outlasted this and this and this fella yeah I'm proud of you I'm Bridget Cary and it's time to say goodbye to the Tech that died in 2024 fossil smart watches are now Smartwatch fossils The Watch Company fossil is no longer making SmartWatches the last Model was the Gen 6 that ran wear OS and if you say well that's because Apple has the best smartw don't hold your breath because Apple can't track your breath anymore this year Apple discontinued selling watches that use the blood oxygen sensor because Apple lost that patent dispute and was ordered to remove the feature that's not the only Apple product to die Apple pay later became Apple pay right away the buy now pay later service was shut down less than a year after it launched Apple also put an end to iTunes yes iTunes still exists for Windows 10 and 11 but to get people to move on Apple made sure that the apps it has in the Microsoft store could handle syncing media between Windows PCS and iPhones that includes the windows version of Apple music the TV app and devices app if losing iTunes makes you sad well Apple certainly does not care about your need to rip your old music CDs because Apple also discontinued it's USB super drive but who needs something to read CDs and DVDs anymore Best Buy stop selling physical movie discs this year and Redbox a company that began 20 years ago announced it was shutting down 24,000 of its kiosks when it filed for bankruptcy and since I'm already breaking the hearts of '90s kids here's another relic of the the '90s that's now gone instant messaging service icq shut down after 27 years so the age of instant messaging is officially dead Google wouldn't be Google if it didn't shut down a bunch of side apps that you didn't know about so I'll just list them and let's see how many you used Google pay in the US ended in June to move everyone to Google Wallet Google podcast discontinued to move everyone to YouTube music Google discontinu the stack PDF scanner app to get everyone to just use gole gole Drive which does the same thing Google one VPN ended and it didn't move everyone to something else because no one was using it Google Jam board shuts down at the end of December it's a digital Whiteboard app for Google workspace but it also was an actual 55 in whiteboard connected to the cloud that cost $5,000 plus a $600 a year annual support fee for a whiteboard yeah I wonder why it died and probably the most notable Google stopped making the chomecast app after 11 years which was a hit because of how cheap it was to stream content to a TV to replace the chomecast Google began selling a $100 device called the Google TV streamer which also streams video but by calling it a new product that can now charge you more to put YouTube videos on your television now some things died quickly and it's a relief they did meta shut down the celebrity lookalike AI chatbots they had the face of a celebrity but they went by different names yes please please kill it with fire Snapchat can't seem to ever get its Hardware to take off it launched a flying camera called the pixie drone and then recalled all of them for overheating batteries Spotify also crashed out in the hardware game it shut down the accessory called car thing which was a thing that stream music in your car it was $100 now that thing is just E-Waste all units don't work and you have until January 14th to request a refund lot of tech dies when it loses use fness and that applies to a well-known robot that retired this year Boston Dynamics said farewell to its hydraulic Atlas humanoid robot as it back flips its way to Oblivion it caused us so much Collective discomfort to see what moves they could get this robot to do and now they made a video of all the ways that also awkwardly rolled to the ground Atlas has been jumping and lifting and doing this stuff for 11 years in development but no time to mourn because the company is working on another more frightening humanoid product to take its place this time fully electric the journey to replace humans with robots is never easy and once such robot has lost funding Moxy the robot is a cartoon faced AI chatbot it's designed to serve as a close friend to a kid it's a developmental toy for young kids to talk to they could play games and learn it was very ambitious and very expensive it was first announced in 2020 and it cost $800 Moxy cannot perform core functionality without connecting to the cloud servers and those Cloud servers cost money there's no more funding owners were abruptly notified that the robot would just stop working because of funding issues but as of the time I am recording this video the company says it is trying to explore options to keep it operational as long as possible and a lot of people online are really upset there are videos of kids who are bracing for their robot buddy to die any day now it is legitimately here's hoping for those kids that Moxy finds a new life in 2025 and if there's another tech product that disappeared this year that I did not include pay your respects in the comments and I'll see you all in the new year", "duration(in seconds)": 342.0, "region": "US"}}

go over its most obvious design features and try to deduce their implications it will also explore just where in the design process China is with its six gen fighter and we will explain just what are we actually looking at when we see the strange looking flying Diamond of a plane [Music] a video that's to come sometime later will go more in depth provide historical context and comparison with the US NextGen program and reveal what does the plane's appearance mean for China and what could it mean for the US for some days now the imminent flight of a Chinese 6G airframe was rumored and well it actually seems to have happened the plane seems to have flown over the city of changdu after the aircraft took off from the factory complex of changdu aircraft Corporation that's the maker of China's j20 fifth gen fighter which was appropriately the chase plane for this occasion so what's the new plane like thankfully the j20 chase plane gives us context due to telephoto lenses used over great distances sizes of two planes can be confidently compared and while j20 has a wingspan of around 13 M this new plane is visibly bigger in fact it's wingspan might reach 20 M which would basically be unheard of for a jet fighter even more so when we look at the planes configuration those are highly swept back Wings basically as one would expect for a supersonic fighter jet length can be estimated from other images suggesting 20 to 22 M that's without the nose Peto tube which is required for testing but the final design years later will not have it the wing trailing Edge is swept forward leading to a diamond Wing shape somewhat reminiscent of YF 23 for example though not as extreme in general the theoretical perfect stealth shape for a plane is one of a so-called hopeless Diamond a perfect rmo shape as flat as possible and with as few protrusions as possible it is obvious the volume of the plane is frankly massive its belly intake start quite forward and the body of the plane is very wide it's plausible ch as Air Force requirement was ranged to threaten Guam such requirement would have driven the design to grow so large coupled with a huge Wing area that plane is simply oversized not necessarily in a bad way but it is sized to accept a huge amount of fuel and a hint of the line where the weapons Bay should be suggests its weapons Bay might be almost 6 M long which is coincidentally the length of China's latest long range pl17 missile of course with such a huge body cruise missiles larger than the US jasm might also easily fit what also seems visible are sensor apertures around the nose not just the nose radum but also a few different cheek side arays the plane has a visible cockpit cover so it's manned so far images aren't good enough to deduce if it's big enough to seat two people the rumors before the flight did suggest the plane has side bys side seating meaning two pilot similar to F-111 or s34 that doesn't mean we are looking at the strike aircraft as six generation Fighters are going to wage air Warfare in a different way but given the size of the plane and its weapons Bay it's also quite plausible the shown design is really a multi-roll plane to cover all sorts of Air Combat and ground strike missions but we digress one of the most striking features perhaps unique in the world is its engine Arrangement this plan seems to have three engines lined up in the rear with the side engines using belly slash side intakes and the middle engine seems to have a separate dorsal intake such an arrangement is unheard of for an actual fighter jet that managed to get off a drawing board side intakes seem to be of carette type similar to say F22 and not of the worthless supersonic Inlet type which F35 and j20 use whether that suggests higher top speeds intended is for now unknown certainly the high sweep of the Wings coupled with the even higher sweep of one continuous line of the nose blending into the wing Roots suggests a fairly High theoretical mock figure now why three engines it's too early to tell but off the bat it could suggest designer simply could not make powerful enough yet compact enough engines for such a plane and keep the design confined to the more usual two Engine Solution this thing is massive one can clearly see double wheel Bogies used for main landing gear given its size it seems likely its Max takeoff weight is designed for maybe even 50 tons in the olden era that would be a tactical bomber but planes have been getting bigger over the decades and NextGen planes from all countries are likely to be heavier than their predecessors even so this thing is plausibly so big that even two of China's most powerful engines the ws15 which May in its future variants approach 200 kons of thrust may not be enough to power it hence possibly the need for three engines it's also plausible that the middle engine is somewhat different and that engine usage is managed for various situations and needs it is not known if China is going with variable cycle engines like the us but if it's not China may have optimized one engine for supersonic speed While others would be regular designs compromised to operate both both at takeoffs and supersonic speeds also three engines might be needed to supply the plane with enough electricity modern planes are so full of power demanding features that the power generation is becoming more and more of a bottleneck imagine a laser self defense feature is also added in the future that too would require tons of electricity finally the whole design should be a pretty big jump up in terms of stealth in 2022 US general Mark Kelly said China was on track with the development of their sixth generation fighter and that China is eyeing to make its stealth exponentially better it's a contextless statement but the plane we are looking at is clearly what a lot of six gen proposals have been proposing a tailless shape of simplified geometry the fact it doesn't seem to have any regular vertical control surfaces is very likely going to make it harder to control than previous gen planes almost certainly impacting its maneuverability but six gen designs don't seem to be about maneuverability that will likely be the job of unmanned drones flying in front of these big manned Fighters it's possible that three engines are also in some way there to help stabilize the plane certainly the split flaps near the wing tips are there to help control the plane the B2 bomber uses a similar concept but in a cruising stage of the flight those would close shut and be flush with the wings it's too early to speculate much more about this plane but it's seems to be a big step up in China's capability so we will leave that speculation for another video coupled with comparisons to us 6 gen and what all this might mean for both China and us right now it's just a prototype actually if rumors are to be believed it's more like a demonstrator kind of like yf-23 was or yf-22 was or the X32 and x35 War and rumor has it that China hasn't yet decided on the final manufacturer so this may be in fact a proposal from changu aircraft Corporation with another six gen plane proposal demonstrator plane from shangyang aircraft Corporation to fly soon some early images May indicate that has already happened but that's another story depending on where us 6G program is at China might have leaped frog the US Air Force a little bit if this is indeed a pre-selection prototype and if us has so far FL only concept and six gen technology demo planes then China might have actually flown the world's first six gen fighter [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 541.0, "region": "US"}}

back to Earth one issue involves the reaction control system specifically helium leaks but while why is helium so important helium an inner gas is used to pressurize the propellant that feed the thrusters if too much helium is lost the thrusters may not function properly which could be critical during the flight particularly in the capsule's propulsion system during the docking procedure the

into space the first stage Burns for about 2.5 minutes before separating and returning to Earth for a controlled Landing meanwhile the second stage aites propelling crew Dragon into orbit this is the orbit adjustments and phasing once an orbit crew Dragon performs a series of small engine Burns to fine-tune its trajectory toward the International Space Station gradually the spacecraft aligns its orbit to match that of the station now comes the approach and docking stage using it onboard navigation systems crew Dragon autonomous ly approaches the ISS it carefully slows down and aligns with the docking port before securely latching onto the station using its docking mechanism let's look at the hatch opening and crew transfer process before opening the hatch between crew dragon and the ISS pressure Equalization is performed once the hatch is open the astronauts move into the station where they are welcomed by the ISS crew the Handover period typically lasts between 3 to 5 days during which the departing crew trains and brief the incoming members on ongoing experiments station operations and other essential tasks once everything is set undocking initiation begins crew dragon autonomously disengages from the ISS docking port releasing the soft capture system and retracting the docking hooks of the hard capture system with a gentle push from Springs the spacecraft slowly drifts away from the station while this process is automated manual backup systems are in place if needed as crew Dragon moves away depart burns are performed using its thrusters the first burn slightly increases the distance from the ISS once these burns are complete the spacecraft enters independent flight mode meaning it is now flying freely in orbit preparing for the next phase of the journey to ensure proper alignment with the re-entry path facing Burns and orbit adjustments take place crew Dragon gradually lowers its orbit through a series of controlled Burns positioning itself for a critical D orbit maneuver this is a crucial step carefully calculated by Mission Control to guide crew Dragon toward its designated Landing Zone the Draco thrusters fire for several minutes slowing the spacecraft and directing it toward Earth's atmosphere before re-entry this is where Trump jettison occurs the trunk which houses the spacecraft's solar panels and radiators is detached and left to burn up in the atmosphere while the capsule continues its controlled descent as crew Dragon enters the atmosphere experiences the most intense phase of the journey traveling X speeds exceeding 17,500 mph the capsule endures extreme heat and pressure with its heat shield providing protection the build of a plasma around the spacecraft causes a brief blackout in Communications a normal but dramatic part of re-entry once the fiery descent is complete the parachute deployment and splash down sequence begins at around 18,000 ft which is around 5 5 km two parachutes deploy to stabilize the capsule moments later at 6,000 ft this is around 1.8 km four main parachutes fully open ensuring a smooth and controlled descent crew Dragon then splashes down in either the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico depending on weather conditions after splash down recovery and crew extraction operations begin immediately SpaceX recovery teams quickly arrive by both securing the capsule and assisting the astronauts following medical checks the crew is transported back to land marking the successful completion of their journey home let's take a look at this $ 1.5 billion Boeing star liner with a capacity of carrying five crew in the difference between the other capsule at the Russian soya in Space X crew 10 unlike its counterparts such as musk's SpaceX dragon or the Russian soas the Starliner is designed to land on Solid Ground rather than in the ocean if accomplishes this by deploying a combination of drug parachutes then releasing the main choot and finally deploying airbags to land on hard surfaces cushioning the hard Landings here are the height comparison between the various spacecraft along with an average human to help you understand the scale better for further comparison we can place the SpaceX crew dragon and the Russian soya spacecraft beside the Boeing star liner interestingly the Starliner weighs a staggering 978,000 924 lb which translates to around 44,000 kg when fully fueled for launch to give you an idea of how heavy this is consider this school bus Which weighs around 36,000 lb this means the star liner's weight is equivalent to almost 27 buses that's a tremendous amount of weight as it is much smaller than its counterpart we make original 4K 3D animation with a small team of animators so please support us by subscribing and dropping in a comment

Dividends are \nprofits paid out four times a year to all   shareholders. The size of the dividend depends \non the profit of the company. Capital gains are   when a stockholder simply sells their stock for \nmore than they originally paid for it. If the   stockholder made a profit, it’s a capital gain. \nIf they lost money, it’s a capital loss. A market   for buying and selling stock is called a stock \nexchange. Brokerage firms are businesses that   help stockholders trade stocks and sometimes \neven deal out stocks. These days, anyone can   easily access the stock exchange on their phone \nthrough apps that offer brokerage services.  A bond is essentially an IOU issued by a \ncorporation or by some level of government.   When you buy a bond, you are loaning money \nin return for a guaranteed payout at a later   date. Bonds are usually a more stable investment \nthan stocks. There are three components of bonds:   their coupon rate, maturity date, and \npar value amount. The coupon rate is   the interest rate that a bond issuer will \npay to the bondholder. The time at which   payment to a bondholder is due is called \nthe bond’s maturity. A bond’s par value,   assigned by whoever issues the bond, is the \namount to be paid to the bondholder at maturity.  In order for investment to take place, an \neconomy first must have a financial system,   which is the network of structures and mechanisms \nthat allows the transfer of money between savers   and borrowers. As we learned in the previous \ntutorial, when people save their money,   they often are actually lending funds to others. \nSavers and borrowers may be linked directly   through what’s known as financial intermediaries. \nFinancial intermediaries are institutions that   help move funds from savers to borrowers. \nThey include banks, which we learned about   in the previous tutorial, but they also include \nmutual funds, hedge funds, and pension funds.  A mutual fund pools the savings of many \nindividuals and invests this money in a variety   of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. A \nhedge fund is a private investment organization   that employs risky strategies that can often \nmake huge profits for investors. In general,   these investors already have tremendous \nwealth and are knowledgeable about investing.  A pension fund is income that some retirees \nreceive after working a certain number of   years or reaching a certain age. In some cases, \ninjuries may also qualify a working person for   certain pension benefits. Employers set up \npension funds by collecting deposits, and   pension fund managers then invest those deposits \nin stocks, bonds, and other financial assets.  In general, the best way to invest your money is \nto put it in a diverse range of securities. This   reduces risk, especially when stock or bond \nprices drop. Therefore, people often invest   some of their money in more risky ventures but \ninvest the rest in more stable funds. It is also   better to invest money earlier in life. This \nis because one of the greatest assets is time.   The longer your money is invested in securities, \nthe more it will grow. Put another way, you make   more money on the money your money already makes.\nWhen investing money, it’s important to consider   the two types of interest, simple and compound. \nSimple interest is based on the principal amount   of a loan or deposit. Compound interest is based \non the principal amount and the interest that   accumulates on it in every period. Thus, it can \nbe regarded as “interest on interest.” Simple   interest is only calculated on the principal \namount of a loan or deposit. The formula looks   like this: A = P(1 + rt) where A is the final \namount, P is the initial principal balance,   r is the annual interest rate, and t is \ntime, usually in years. Compound interest   is calculated based on both the principal and \ninterest accrued. The formula looks like this:   A = P(1 + r/n)nt where A is the final amount, \nP is the initial principal balance, r is the   interest rate, n is the number of times interest \nis applied per time period, usually in years,   and t is the number of periods elapsed.\nLet’s look at an example. Say you loaned   $10,000 to a friend and they agreed to \npay it back in five years with an annual   simple interest rate of 5%. After five years, the \namount of interest you would get would be $2,500,   as the total amount they would repay would be \n$12,500, which is the original principal plus   the interest. Now say you loaned $10,000 to a \nfriend and they agreed to pay it back in five   years with an annual compound interest rate of \n5%. Because you really want to make some money,   you also make sure that interest is compounded \nmonthly, or 12 times a year. After five years,   the amount of interest you would get would now \nbe $2,833.59, and your friend would have repaid   you a total of $12,833.59. This example serves to \nillustrate that compound interest is far superior   to simple interest when investing your money.\nWhenever consumers evaluate an investment,   they must balance the risks involved with the \nrewards they expect to gain from the investment.   In general, the higher the potential return \non an investment, the riskier that investment   is. In the next tutorial, we will look at one of \nthe riskiest ways to borrow money, credit cards.", "duration(in seconds)": 446.0, "region": "US"}}

finance, Financial well-being, 1 finance, money explained, money talks, money relationship, spending money, personal finance, stressed, money problem status", "script": "make your money work for you but no one is fairly guided to do so money money money but what's the use of such money which makes you stressed all the time about your financial condition financial planning is often assumed as investing but we skip the most important step which is planning your expens income assets and liability planning the first step towards financial planning is financial awareness and [Music] education but working out is never enough if you don't have a good diet plan right similarly if you're not financially aware and keep investing in the best asset class you will never get financial well-being so let's find out in today's episode what Financial Planning and awareness are and what are the right steps towards it [Music] hi I'm gorov karic I've been into personal finance space for last 10 years we've been helping individuals and families to achieve their financial goals uh we've done that for 600 plus families one thing that motivates me to do it is improve the relationship with money that people have and also at some point uh help them gain control over their fin finances and have Financial Freedom so that money means lot more than survival for [Music] them the one thing that comes in the mind is culturally we are always programmed to think about right or wrong but we get our education also thinking that we earn money and those professions which earn more are are celebrated like be your doctor Engineers be any of the of these things right we are not programmed to think about expenses we not programmed to think about the real life situations where money is needed so it takes time for us when someone goes through certain hard times then they start valuing planning uh that much more right it's it's like saying that the kid who has failed in maths will then take efforts to be more systematic about studying maths right also I feel that we have not seen more of uh Role Models uh where we have seen that people have planned and did things culturally we also came from so with the thought process that we have is we always told that somewh survival mind these are the things we don't want to think of hard work we again we are not okay so our relationship with money is ends to mean we don't see money as empowering energy you have to start thinking basically which means that the power of choice is yours whereas our relationship with money for most of us is that we don't see money as a empowering force or energy for us and that's where the thought process barrier for planning when I ask clients uh to fill a questionnaire and tell us about what they want to do with their money uh in let's say 2 years 5 years or 10 years that's where they go blank because we have never put our thought process there and that's why it's little more difficult that's why procrastination comes into picture and that's that's one of the major factor for us not planning it's a mix of both if you see in the last 20 years techn technology has exploded media has exploded the combination of both is such that you have everything available in your fingertips in terms of information in terms of information about financial products also it's very readily available but in the whole uh scheme of things what is not grown is awareness who has been talking about these things are intermediaries uh media houses so they are talking about financial products or financial information uh the stress is not on how I manage things how I should do certain things because I am I am sold to I I am the product which is sold to right and that's why in the whole uh I would say last 20 years the there's there's been information explosion happening at the same time relationship that people develop with their money has also gone down so I don't think how my relationship with money is how I should spend money and how do I want to structure it rather than I consume the information and based on the information some impulsive decisions are made which we call as financial planning professional working professionals who are earning good and who are at a very good stage they struggle with the basic thing like where do I spend my money so when when we ask them to articulate their expenses of of their month how much do you spend for dining how much do you spend for travel that's where you start struggling that tells us that we are not putting our thought in how I I should be spending it is more of an splurging it's more of a something pops up and I I I I buy I purchase things that may or may not be needed for me uh so the one thing I've seen is that uh us being not aware uh about how do I want to spend my money I often say this that financial planning doesn't mean that you save and hold up everything but you direct your money where you want it to go rather than someone else driving that decision maybe it's maybe it's a e-commerce site or maybe it's someone else uh it's more about being in charge of how you want to direct this energy called money in your life I would say that money is a taboo in India we've always told that but if you see for us for a country like India we are having lot of population and in some way we are poor so the two things we should be taught about are not spoken at all money management I mean I have to use it right and I need to know it be it kid who is not even earning money but he needs to spend money to get his chocolates or a grandpa who is not earning money but he still needs to spend money for his medicines right so that's one common thread that across ages is a skill set that is needed but I think that's a crime that we have done in the education system I would say that we have not spoken enough and we have not created enough systems to teach about money management the one thing I would do is that when I was taught maths in third grade when I was told that if Ram had 5,000 rupees of sum in that statement I would give cash to that kid because because once you start having that real money in your world and the amount doesn't matter that's where you you start thinking about how I'm going to spend uh so one thing I would change is that I would encourage that parents give pocket money and then have some accountings some accountability done there so that they are spending their their money in their way be even if they're spending 80% in the chocolates but at least you know that kid is spending that way he feels empowered and I think there's that's where that's the start of relationship ship with money where you can start with as we are moving ahead explosion of information is going to be all the more and what I'm scared about is that the the information is going to come from the product manufacturers from the newer product manufacturers who have their own vested interests so till the time we don't create enough noise around it in the right way Financial education is going to be something which is people will discover till the time it is not mainstream education and it's something uh where where you discuss over dinner tables I I I see a very gloomy picture in fact uh so what I'm trying to say is that it has to be conscious effort in in the education system and in the families uh to to change the relationship with money when you're thinking about financial planning think about how you want to spend the money uh I think the first block is that we we we think that how do I want to invest the money and because I've not done that I don't know how to do that that I don't want to do that so it's it's not something that you have not done [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 560.0, "region":

sell and in the long run that will help a lot second question which S&P 500 Index Fund have I chosen to go with I've gone with the tickle symbol vo which is vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund with an expense ratio of 0.03% as compared to spy which has an expense ratio of 0.09% and then comes the sub question why not CPX on ibkr which has lesser withholding tax because it's doop in Ireland between the two it's 15% withholding tax and 30% withholding tax the answer to that is that I do not look at the dividend income that comes in when I'm invested into the S&P 500 I have other dividend stocks that I'm currently building in the Singapore stock market it is more for the Capital Growth in the next 20 30 40 years down the road when it comes to my S&P 500 Index Fund investment another reason on why not CPX on ibkr is a matter of preference over platform I prefer using Cy tra as compared to ibkr the interface Etc in addition to that because of how much I'm investing into the S&P 500 Index Fund per month it is more worth it having the two free trades per month as compared to paying fees and investing into CPX on ibkr there's a video that I've watched that has broken down all of this and the comparisons up to which level and how much per month that will make it more worth it to invest into the S&P 500 Index Fund CPX on IBK I'll link the video down in the description box below you can watch that after this video now let's go into the table where I've broken down the past Year's investment into Vu and also the investment mistake that I've done what I plan to do in 2024 let's go this EXL sheet right over here as you can see multiple times I've bought into it per month at the start because side trades platform as a new user back then it was five free trades right now as a new user it's unlimited free trades in the US Stock Market for the first 3 months thereafter it will go back to the two free trades per month in this notion table I've rounded up the numbers and total it up take a guess if you can tell what was the investment mistake that I've made so in November 2022 was when I first started my investment job Journey covered in this video saying that I'm not too late and for those of you who are watching this onean thing to get started it is still not too late November 2022 it was $300 December was $350 January was $140 February was 178 the leas goes on in April and also in June was my lowest amount invested the current capital as of today is at $2,878 averaging out per month is USD $260 my average price right now is at $374 185 as of third of January as of the date that I'm filming this it is right now at $434 And1 the unrealized percentage profit is at 15.78% on the channel I've actually had a six months return on investment video that I've done back then Roi was at 8% did you guys take a guess as to what was the investment mistake that I've made it's actually not setting up recurring buys into the S&P 500 I did not dollar cost average my way consistently and as you can see how much I've invested into per month fluctuated a lot and it's very emotionally driven which I want to correct in 2024 if you take a look at this table November December I've done it diligently consistently investing into roughly about $300 $350 and then as I saw the price rise in January and also February I invested lesser and March when it deep I bought more then April it rose again and I only used dividends to buy that is the emotion that I want to remove when it comes to investing into the S&P 500 at the end of the day I'm investing into this for the the next 20 to 30 years until the age of 50 60 70 years old I'm not sure when I will actually sell it off in 2023 the S&P 500 actually gave a return of 20 over per. had I invested per month consistently my returns on investment would have been so much more so that is what my mistake was and is what I want to correct in 2024 so now let's go into what my dollar cost averaging strategy will be in 2024 let's go I first considered how the S&P 500 will fit into my overall personal finance plan so from the lowest of risk to the highest of risk I have cpf there's also the bonds that I've invested into and will hold until maturity I do have dedicated videos I'll link up above and down in the description box below then there is also the Singapore Banks and rits of which I'm investing into build that portfolio size big enough so that you'll generate dividends then the highest of risk would be the S&P 500 and I'm also looking at the NASDAQ 100 I have not started on that yet but if you want me to share more subsequently if I do start let me know in the comment section down below my plan is monthly I will put in USD $400 into the S&P 500 an equivalent amount of SGD 50050 depending on the currency conversion at that point of time assuming a conservative average rate of return of about 8% on the S&P 500 in 32 years time when I'm 60 years old the portfolio would have grown to USD $730,000 my Capital would have been USD $150,600 I do need to plan on the plan not going according to BL so if you take a look at the S&P 500 it has given good returns in the past whether will it continue in 20 to 30 years time I'm not sure nobody knows nobody is 100% sure I just want a slice of the pie if things do go well and hence I'm not just invested into the S&P 500 and it is also not a significant size of the entire portfolio that I'm looking to build this emphasizes the importance of diversification which brings me to today's sponsor stash away more than this just being a sponsored portion of the video how I I think this would fit the majority of people is you want to invest your money in a more hands off approach meaning you don't want to have to spend time to research on a particular stock to invest into then every now and then have to check whether are these stocks still okay then a manag portfolio can actually work for you and that's where stash away comes in they are a wealth management platform helps to invest our money in a more hands-off approach have professionals manage the portfolio and you just go about doing your day-to-day activities stash away has two general investing portfolios one is powered by stash away another is powered by Black Rock and investment management company how are they both different the one powered by stash away is more catered towards the risk level that you are comfortable with so when you go to the app and you start a portfolio you do have to indicate what is the risk level percentage that you're comfortable with and they will cater that portfolio to the risk level that you have indicated the one with Black Rock You Have To indicate based on the equity and bonds allocation it has a broader Market exposure with more ETFs in that portfolio so depending on what your style of investing is is and what you're comfortable then go ahead and choose whichever portfolio that is more suitable to your needs if you want to sign up and you're new to stash away you can get your first six months investment managed for free for up to $20,000 so look for the details down in the description box below I hope that in today's video it has helped you gain a clearer picture of how you can also incorporate various Investments so that you are Diversified more than just thep 500 if you have any questions as always leave them down in the comment section below I hope today's video has been helpful for for you and I'll see you in my next video bye-bye", "duration(in seconds)": 502.0, "region": "US"}}

this there are still a few unanswered questions but finally we got the detail on what Donald Trump meant by this liberation day and let me just kind of start by showing you these bars are how high those tariffs the US tariffs are on various different countries around the world at the moment or rather before Donald Trump came into office and a quick kind of bit of revision on where we've come from so far also uh threatened tariffs uh on Mexico and Canada they were repeatedly threatened repeatedly rescinded uh or lifted um but they might well be back again who knows but for the time being they're gone uh we know we got an extra 10% uh tariffs on China China 1.0 then another extra 10% tariffs on China 2.0 you might call them uh and uh we're now kind of waiting to find out what will happen next and we finally did find it out um let's just start there are two parts to this okay so first of all there is going to be a 10% baseline tariff so you see all of these bars go up by 10% uh including of course the UK but that as far as the White House is concerned is just a baseline and then on top of that there are different tariffs for different nations what they call reciprocal tariffs and they say they've gone through the numbers they've looked at not just the tariffs that other countries around the world are charging the US but also uh what they call non-tariff barriers so other things uh and they've worked out uh by the way Canada those Mexico Canada tariffs might well come back so we might well start from that position but reciprocal tariffs might push all of these bars or will push all of these bars up considerably higher so just look at how the picture of trade and tariffs in the US has changed dramatically as a result uh of these measures which are coming in in the next few days and just to give you a few highlights of what we're talking about so uh you could look for instance uh over there at China so China that's a 34% reciprocal tariff but it takes the total amount provided that goes on top of the existing tariff it takes the total amount up above 50% and you're talking you know when tariffs are going above 50% that makes any trade very very difficult and far less likely to happen uh so that's China but you can probably see here uh Vietnam as well and the point here from the White House has been to say listen lots of Chinese goods going into the US but also going through being Vietnam and Cambodia as well being conduits uh for goods to go to America the point here from Donald Trump has that we the US wants to re-industrialize and so it's all about trying to make things domestically but finally uh look at the UK 10% on the UK and for many people uh here obviously it is a big increase on where things were before only a few percent uh the average rate for the UK but that goes up to 10% uh it is the best rate that anyone has uh amongst any nations in fact the best rate that uh any G7 any leading economy in the world uh has and certainly better than the EU all of whom are having to pay an extra 20% in total so 10% another 10% on top but even so all of this will potentially uh diminish the amount of trade going on around the world and diminish the amount of stuff going into the US and finally it's worth just saying what was the stock market reaction well this decision was made after markets had closed but we can look at the futures market this is the NASDAQ futures market and look at what happened it went up a little bit after the announcement and then it's come down quite considerably so a market reaction there which implies that when markets open in Asia and indeed when they were open uh across the US and Europe we're going to see some falls to come as people respond to this ed take a seat i've got another question for you uh there is an more coming out of the White House right now senior White House officials etc trump has to sign an order that closes the dimminimous loophole this is according to an aid tell us why that is significant and how it might affect a nation like China for example so this is and this is on top of all of those things we're showing you dimminimus basically means that for really small kind of low value items that are going in and out of countries you just a lot of that stuff just isn't charged a tariff so what is a tariff ultimately it is just you know we're going to charge you 20% on everything that comes into the country although it's it's it's the recipient that actually pays it but for fast fashion for items that are going in that are relatively cheap and this is a big thing for China you know you've got companies like Shien who who are sending stuff relatively cheaply from Guangong in different parts of China right now that's not subject to any tariffs donald Trump said earlier on so when he had one of his early kind of we're going to impose tariffs on China he said we're getting rid of dimminimus but then what happened was that suddenly uh in airports around the US you were seeing massive big piles of goods that no one was quite sure what to do with because it's it's an enormous administrative challenge and I think that Anna is the is the bigger issue here raising all of these tariffs different tariffs on different countries and a kind of extraordinary smog board of different numbers we've just seen and Donald Trump you know held up this this this chart of all the different numbers it is likely to just increase the amount of work that it takes for America to to to collect these tariffs but the point that Donald Trump wants to make can I show one more chart like as a bonus thing but the point that Donald Trump wants to make is that back in a long time ago the majority of federal revenues came from tariffs raising money from tariffs and right now that line is basically down you know close to zero kind of only a few percent and his point is always rather than raising money through income tax couldn't we raise it again through tariffs and I you know I'll spare you the next charts that point out that ultimately that is really really tough to do it's really tough in the modern world of 2025 when you have you know welfare states when you have Medicare when you have you know standing armies that are quite expensive you can't just raise all of your money through tariffs no one has been able to do that and so that is the challenge that he's faced with right now but what he wants to do is to be able to say we're going to try and re-industrialize hence all of those tariffs on China on Vietnam on Cambodia and we're going to try and raise a bit of money from it in the process and I think that's that's the selling point but what comes next is the retaliation you know we start to hear from you know Europe and we know they're going to retaliate what comes next is more market reaction and this is going to roll and roll even though we've got detail tonight we're going to be talking about this for for many weeks and months to", "duration(in seconds)": 400.0, "region": "US"}}

14 he now he has seven patty interesting night man and you have had a lot of them here in the UFC but this one I mean now you're you're calling out Gachi and they're showing him on the screen dustin Porier is up here i mean this is just a different level of energy you're in the biggest conversations now does it feel any different to you no i always said this was going to happen you know what I mean Brett i always said this was in me future people laughed at me when I first said it and said I ain't going to do it i can remember getting laughed at and said I'll never be ranked i'll never then it was now I'll never be in the top 10 now I'm in going to be rank seven on Monday and then I'm coming for the top five and then the title and can I ask you I think I've asked you this before but you you are so fueled by doubters you know you called them a gang of mushrooms today and it is you you come up here and you say you say it in every uh postfight speech too you're like what now you know I I keep proving you wrong why do you love proving the doubters so wrong it's just something something in my city we love doing you know what I mean in Liverpool people try and put us down they have done for years and years and years and we just love proving people wrong and coming back and showing everyone that we won't be beaten you know what I mean we'll keep coming back and coming back and coming back that knee was absolutely lovely by the way that's just picture perfect watching it back oh especially the amount of drilling I've done in the gym with that we game plan everything everything that we do is meticulous all the stuff that I do with me team and you'll probably see some of the stuff from me videographer come out on YouTube the next few days of us throwing that knee and throwing some of the shots that we did in that in the fight and I just everything went perfectly tonight everything went perfectly apart from this map that Matt B is no joke well if that's the worst thing that happened to you I think you're all right fight with Michael Chandler do you think we're sleeping on your striking a little bit because of course I was going to bring up that knee and that was sensational and I think he was pretty much done from from that moment on are we under over underlooking your uh striking a bit everyone underestimates me strike and everyone thinks I'm just a grappler you know what I mean and I think like obviously no disrespect to the fighters who are mentioning here Dustin Justin and Charles I've just put more of a clinic on the feet against Michael Chandler than they did they got caught with shots against Chandler i hardly got hit i think I got hit with one overhand in the first round and I've seen the judges scorecards after it as well but whatever them two judges are what give the first round to him need sack they need given the P45 lad cuz how on earth do you give that first round to him like he pushed me against the cage and held me there for a little minute or two but whenever we were separate I was the one striking on him i was done landing on him he couldn't get near me and that's what I said was going to happen i said I keep him on the end of me jab keep him on the end of me punches just keep him on the end of me kicks and I did it and the game plan worked perfectly you are not a guy who is short on confidence you know you you've been that way I think really since your amateur career i mean you were on the the the uh the forums talking trash to the trolls way back then but a fight like this I mean you did everything you said you were going to do you said that you know they say that he's got the more knockout power i think if anybody gets knocked out it's going to be him he's got the division one wrestling i think I'll be fine in the wrestling department and both of those proved to be true but when you do it so convincingly this does have to even raise your confidence even higher right to go out there and do that to somebody like Michael Chandler yeah of course this just like I knew that I was going to do this so it has obviously raised your confidence a bit more but at the same time I knew I was going to do this i knew I was going to come out and I was going to beat Michael Chandler it was just where I was going to finish him and I said this in the fighters meeting yesterday with DC and um Megan and Levy and John Anak it was like there's so many different ways that I can see myself finishing them that I don't know how I'm going to do it i said flying triangle i said stepping in with an elbow i said a knee i said uppercut said me backhand said me left hook i said the re naked choke i said the multiple different chokes and armbar i said ground and palm with elbows i was saying I can't wait to 12 to six elbow someone and I finally got to do it finally got to I was going to say it almost seemed like like you had an option at one point i mean even Chelsea Son was sitting up here and he was like \"What why isn't he throwing the choke on it seems to be there.\" And it's like \"Do you want to get on top and throw those elbows?\" I wanted to get on top and throw those elbows i wanted to like obviously I was looking for the submission but after watching Charles fight him and Charles didn't get the submission hunting for it for rounds i thought there's no point in hunting for a submission when I can finish him with ground and pound as I say we game plan perfectly and that's what we did like I know he's got good submission defense so we altered that and put it on him with ground and pound instead cuz I knew I'd finish him i knew I was getting the finish tonight i said within two so it was a little 3 minutes too late but I still got the finish within three rounds well you had some absolutely fun fights ahead of you here at all big names all high ranks superstars really it's felt like in the post speech Charles is is the top one or Yeah it's just Charles like for me Charles a legend jars former UFC lightweight champion defended the belt twice you know beat Dustin beat Justin beat Michael for the belt like he's a legend he's got the most submissions in UFC history and people say that he is the best submission artist the UFC's ever seen but I think I'm a better submission artist so I'd love for that fight but obviously then there's Justin there's Dustin there's Armon but will he  the better not turn up on the day you never know so I don't know if I'd want to fight him obviously there's Elchito as well the Zillia yes I forgot all about mentioning him in the postfight interview there's also Conor McGregor who was seeing put a bet on Michael Chandler you know what I mean with me the scoutish connection lad you're meant to back your own so if he wants to punching him when he comes back I'm game to beat McGregor up yeah i mean I would take any one of those and Elia I got to believe that that's going to happen at some point i was going to let you go but then they just told me in my ear they've got some video of something that happened backstage you were Oh yeah this little maggot can you tell us what's going on he does something when there's a camera about i seen him I seen him at power slap the other week and walk past him staring at him and he looked at the floor like that and then now he knows there's a camera about he walked past so I just said to him \"Mad I'll come and slap you but you'll go and ring the police on me like you did with Mazvidal you little grass.\" Little grass you just said there yeah do you know what that means no I do snitch ah okay you know what I mean but anyway he can eat he pays supermodels to stand with him the bum he's a nobody he's on a threeight losing streak or something he's irrelevant he's trying to use me now to stay relevant because he's a nobody he's a bum i I beat Colby Coington for a laugh but I've got bigger fish to fry than that little mushroom you man you do you have a lot of fish to fry and I'm going to look forward to every single one of those fights the Elia fight again has to happen i just wonder where when but that one's going to be a big one when it happens but they're all going to be big that's a pay-per-view headline with no title on the line you know what I mean you don't need a title on the line for that that's just a pay-per-view Atlanta right there well we'll let we'll uh let you get out of here eat some food enjoy Miami enjoy the win and we'll uh we'll wait to see what's next for you congratulations Patty [Applause] [Music]", "duration(in seconds)": 445.0,

We are learning uh India has sealed the Rafal fighter deal. It's the second mega deal for India and uh this is for 26 Rafal marine aircrafts that has been signed. We understand the deal is worth 63,000 cr rupees and more information now coming in. French defense minister is expected to visit India and that is when the deal is to be signed this month. My colleague Shivar is also now joining us on the broadcast here getting us more on that. Well uh Shiv, we understand uh that this is the second mega deal that's going to be signed by the end of the month. What more details do we have? Uh Kitty, this uh deal for 26 Rafal aircraft is for the Indian Navy. Remember it's India's second uh deal for the French Rafal fighters. The first deal was signed in 2016. That was for 36 Rafal for the Indian Air Force. Those fighters have already been delivered. Uh so this is the second. Uh the aircraft is the same. It's still the Rafal except that these fighters unlike the air force versions will be operating off an aircraft carrier deck. Uh that the INS Vikrant and the INS Vikramitya are the Indian Navy's two aircraft carriers right now which have been hungry for new generation fighters for many years now. The Indian Navy currently operates uh you know the Soviet era MiG 29K fighters off its aircraft carrier decks. Uh and the Indian Navy's air arm has been uh you know wanting next generation fighters for a very very long time. So this is a huge piece of good news for the Indian Navy and also very good news in terms of general Indian air power in the Indian Ocean region because uh these Rafal fighters while very similar to the ones already operated by the Indian Air Force uh you know come with uh uh you know many new capabilities. They will have anti-hship missiles which of course the Indian air force also has that capability but specifically in terms of deterrence fleet defense in the Indian Ocean at a time when the Chinese are being uh increasingly aggressive as far as trying to uh create a mark and create influence in the Indian Ocean. every bit of power and power projection actually matters and these Rafal fighters that the Indian Navy will you know will begin to uh uh receive delivery of maybe in the next couple of years will add to that air power allow the Indian Navy to reestablish its primacy in the Indian Ocean. Very very capable aircraft. This definitely comes as a big boost to the Indian Rafal fleet. That means uh our Rafal fleet is now going to increase to 62 when when these uh Rafal jets are delivered ship. That is correct. uh you you know the the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force have for a long time you know suffered from uh uh the fact that they operate many disparate types of aircraft uh you know which brings in a nightmare of inventory and cost and I think this is one of the few times when the you know the Indian military have decided to acquire a similar kind of aircraft the air force going for the Rafal the Indian Navy also acquiring the Rafal uh you know similar or same aircraft bring with it lots of economies in terms of spare parts in in terms of maintenance repair, overhaul, uh, sustenance, ownership and that kind of thing. Quite apart from the fact kitty that there's going to be a huge amount of synergy obviously between the Indian Navy and the air force. The air force started receiving their Rafals uh during the pandemic uh and they've uh these aircraft have already been operationalized. They've been deployed in Ladak. Some of them are deployed in the eastern sector. Two squadrons with the air force. So over the last few years the air force has gotten very very valuable combat or uh you know preparedness experience with the Rafal. So with the Indian Navy now set to receive these aircraft, it's going to add to their combat potential. There'll be a lot of learnings from the air force, how they've been able to learn about how to use these aircraft in Indian conditions. And let me tell you, Indian combat conditions are vastly different from anywhere else. Uh definitely in France, you know, we're in the tropics. We've got uh the Himalayas to take care of. We've got the eastern sector to take care of. We've got the entire Indian Ocean to defend as well. And that's where these fighters are really going to plug in. So I can tell you it's going to be a very happy day for the Indian Navy. Yes, absolutely. So the deal includes 22 singleseater aircrafts and we understand four twin seater aircrafts which have been designed specifically for Indian Navy's operational requirements. All right, Shiv, we understand. So these Rafal jets uh uh that are uh specifically now designed for India's Navy's uh operational requirements are going to be tailored for operations from our aircraft carrier INS Vikrant. That is correct. Uh uh you know there are when the in when India signed the original deal for Rafals for the Indian Air Force uh a major component of that deal kitty was what was called India specific enhancements. Uh now these India specific enhancements were basically modifications to the original Rafal fighter to uh you know to make them much more compatible with Indian conditions uh Indian combat profiles, Indian threat perceptions uh what are called Indian threat libraries in terms of what India faces from China, Pakistan, the Indian Ocean etc. These are of course of a very classified nature but they have to do with software with different kinds of weapons certain cockpit and electronic equipment as well. uh that is not to be revealed. Uh those India specific enhancements will most certainly be part of the Indian Navy Rafal as well. So what we will be getting is informally called a Rafal I or a Rafal India. Uh because uh while it is the baseline aircraft that the French use and a few other customers have acquired as well. Uh it is customized and tailor made for the very very unique requirements that the Indian military has. Absolutely. Thank you so much for getting us all those details there. Well, of course, a big day for India and India is all set to acquire 26 Rafal jets. This is the second mega deal which is expected to be signed very soon between India and France. India will be uh acquiring these 26 Rafal marine fighter aircraft from France as the center now has cleared a government to government deal as per the information coming in. We are are also learning now the deal is valued at over 63,000 cr rupees and is expected to be signed in the coming few weeks.", "duration(in seconds)": 369.0, "region": "US"}}

assures there are only two nuclear superpowers but that's not the case right now China wasn't a no China was not a signatory but Russia and the United States have more nule actually Russia has more nuclear weapons than every other country except the United States and United States has more nuclear weapons than every other country than Russia right I think China has like 300 nuclear weapons Israel supposedly has 300 why the does Israel have 300 nuclear weapons what the why has the world even allowed that to take place right why unbelievable especially genocidal Nation like Israel right Zionist Israel okay be like a crack yeah no and the United States came out and said oh we we should sign a treaty a new treaty this defense and stuff after they saw Russia using Hypersonic missiles and China came out and said no we're not even in the same ball league as you guys and China's nuclear weapons aren't really ready to be deployed right away right so China was like no we're not even ready to we're not even the same category as you guys so what China is doing right now is they're building up their nuclear defense systems that's what the United States did this is what the United States actions have done they've brought the world to the brink of nuclear war and every Joel blow woke J joow low IQ red rat Joel blow in the western world is saying Iran is proring nuclear weapons we have to protect us from Bad Putin meanwhile they don't realize that the United States pulling out of all these missile treaties right has threatened the entire world and not only that their actions have threatened the entire world what actions they've invaded multiple countries they kicked people pull off the Swift system they've been seizing other Count's assets goals Money Bank everything we're run in the Western World by Psychopaths if people just grasp that Concept in the Western World the world would be a much safer and better place to live because we would make we would mgga right Prime so it's not much of a treaty right if Nations that aren't Russia aren't Bound by if the two major nuclear Powers in Russia and United States the treaties were good enough because China was not building their nuclear weapon Arsenal while those treaties were in existence right they it wasn't a hegemonic world it was a bipolar World in terms of nuclear weapons and China was good enough with Russia keeping the Psychopaths and the United States the warmongers the neocons the neocon Zionist in the United States in czeck China was good enough with that China was like yeah Russia has enough nuclear weapons to wipe the United States off the map and the United States will not launch their nukes right but once they started tearing up these treaties China went well what the now we have to spend money and build up our nuclear Arsenal why because low IQ red rats and the United States and EU NATO they start tearing up these treaties and the American population said yay we have to build it because Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons I'm amazed I could even vocalize that with their heads up their ass right disgusting sorry just how many nuclear weapons do you need to be a threat you need that's the whole point Putin was making with the defense systems right if you're you have missile defense system that can shoot down half your nukes if they can shoot down a lot of if they can shoot let's say you fire 10 missiles right and your defense system can take it out well that means maybe you need 100 missiles right and if you fire 100 missiles and their defense system can shoot down 100 missiles then maybe you need a thousand missiles right which is exactly what was proven in the last year and a half with Iran and the axis of resistance showing to the world that Israel's missile defense system is garbage it it won't protect them right so what did Israel's defense missile defense system do it forced the axis of resistance to build tens of thousands of missiles that's why that's why Putin came out and said why the is the United States pulling tearing up these treaties that have restricted the development of all these nuclear arsenals they're they're forcing us to build out our nuclear weapons capabilities that's exactly it you got to connect the dots as Putin said it's just mathematics there's no emotion involved in this we're not doing this because we think Trump bad us bad Americans bad the way the Western low IQ people woke and every other most of the western world thinks Russians are bad it's all emotion based in the western world Russia functions on a mathematical basis bis that's why what Russia does Will trump what anything the Western world ever does right because Russia is not behaving based on their emotions Russia's behaving based on mathematics right that's it why do you think I say mathematics is extremely important it's the most important thing you can learn in your life aside from reading and writing which should be a given right you only need one nuclear armed state that hasn't sign uh to render the treaty mood uh Israel right Israel hasn't even acknowledged they have nuclear weapons right no you're you're you're going into the hypothetical realm with China now you're saying China bad look dude this speech this this this information that Putin just shared is telling you the threat to the world the nuclear threat to the world is the United States and NATO end the  story every country in the world didn't want to build up nuclear weapons didn't want to build up their arms uh the military-industrial complex but the United States wanted to do it why did they want to do it one of the reasons is because United States is governed by Zionist Israel and Zionist Israel has expansionist ideology they want to take the greater Israel and they know they're going to need the weapons that the United States is developing for them to do it right that's why it's not  just one piece you put it all together it's a clear picture that's what we've been showing building for the last five years that's the reason I stepped away from making full-on just straight up math cooking uh comment book ASMR videos where I sacrificed my channel which by all accounts should have been into the millions of subscribers on censor through where I started creating political and economic content to tell people look man we're going down a dark path we got a lot of low IQ little rat rats living in the Western World you being one of them no offense to you but you being one of them because you're looking at one piece of the puzzle you can't even put the pieces together I'm building the  picture for you I've been building the picture for you for five six seven 8 years now that it's  right there in your face and you're like where's the piece Here For  sakes man like what else do I have to do right do I have to actually physically come there Lube your head pull your head out of your ass put it in front of the screen and say look at this I I can't even explain the  no more to people right it's unfuckingbelievable best thing you can do Prime hectic right now is take a fiveyear Hiatus from politics economics everything go learn a little bit of mathematics go learn some statistics go learn a little bit of calculus right stop watching corporate Western corporate propaganda right and then come back to everything and everything you've looked at in the past rewatch everything reread everything and it all makes sense to you right and then we can talk gang I hope you have a fantastic rest of your week

They have the strongest,   most formidable and expensive fighter jets that \never existed. These are all necessary to defend   the small island nation that they have. But how \nstrong are we talking about? Can they really   compete against their neighboring giants like \nIndonesia? Or are their fighter jets not enough   to actually compete against a country that is \nwell over a hundred times its size? Well, to   understand this, let’s talk about the fighter jets \nof Singapore, and compare them to its neighbors. The face of Singapore’s airforce and fighter jets \nhave long been the F16. The F-16 fighting falcon   as it is known hails from the General Dynamics, \na United States company. It is a single-engine   supersonic multirole fighter aircraft initially \ndeveloped for the United States Air Force. When   it was designed, it had a role as an air \nsuperiority day fighter. But it eventually   evolved into a versatile all-weather multirole \naircraft. In 1993, General Dynamics would   sell off its aircraft manufacturing business to \nLockheed which would change the face of the F16s. Singapore, on the other hand, had acquired \ntheir F16s through several contracts. The   very first one started way back in April \nof 1984, when the Peace Carvin letter of   agreement was signed. This facilitated the \nsale of eight F-16A/B aircraft to Singapore   at a total cost of $272 million dollars. The \nfirst aircraft was delivered in February 1988,   with the rest following throughout the year. \nInitially, these aircraft were used for training   at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, until they \nwere relocated to Singapore by January 1990. In July 1994, under the Peace Carvin II \nprogram, Singapore signed an agreement   for 18 Block 52 F-16C/D aircraft. The first \nof these aircraft was accepted in April 1998,   with all deliveries completed that year. \nAdditionally, in July 1996, Singapore signed a   commercial lease for 12 new Block 52 aircraft \nfor training purposes in the United States,   which were delivered in the latter half of 1998 \nand operated at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. Throughout the coming years, Singapore \nwould increase its total F16 aircrafts.   Today, however, these aircrafts have been aging. \nThey are now decades old! Which is why overtime,   the Republic of Singapore Air Force or RSAF have   been upgraded to ensure they are up \nto date to deal with modern threats. One of the most significant upgrades done \nlately is in 2023. The ChannelNewsAsia   reported that the RSAF have received their newly \nupgraded F16 fighter jets. Their capabilities   were enhanced to ensure operational readiness \nuntil the mid-2030s. These upgrades include   the Active Electronically Scanned Array \n(AESA) Radar, which allows the F-16 to   track and engage multiple targets from \ngreater distances, and an all-weather,   ground-attack capability that enables \nprecision strikes with more advanced munitions. Additionally, the F-16s have been equipped with \nmodern air-to-air missiles like the Python-5,   enhancing their ability to engage a wide range \nof air threats with improved lethality and   survivability. The new Air-to-Ground munitions \nsystem allows for precise strikes in day and   night conditions using weapons such as \nthe Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition. Now, besides the F-16, Singapore \nhas been acquiring newer fleets,   ones that will replace the F16 in the \nfuture. One of these is the F-15E Strike   Eagle. They acquired the advanced variant of \nthis aircraft which is known as the The F-15SG.   These aircrafts were developed by Boeing, \nwhich is also another American company. The contract for this aircraft was signed back \nin December of 2005. The Government of Singapore   signed a $1.6 billion contract with Boeing \nfor 12 F-15SG fighter jets to replace their   older fighter aircrafts. This was to replace the \nA-4SU Super Skyhawk attack aircraft, which is a   very old attack aircraft that was developed from \nthe Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, a single-seat subsonic   carrier-capable light attack aircraft manufactured \nby American aerospace and defense company Douglas   Aircraft Company. The first F-15SG was rolled \nout in November 2008 and delivered in May 2009. Prior to the delivery, the Singapore Ministry \nof Defense ordered four additional F-15SGs and   exercised an option for eight more, \nas part of the original contract.   The RSAF declared the full operational \ncapability of the F-15SG in September   2013. The final batch of eight fighters was \ndelivered between early 2016 and July 2017. In terms of its armaments, The F-15SG has \n15 weapon stations and can be equipped   with a variety of weapons, including up to \neight AIM-120 or AIM-9X air-to-air missiles,   15,500 lb of laser-guided bombs, and Maverick \nair-to-surface missiles. It also features an   internal General Dynamics M-61A1 20mm Gatling gun \ncapable of firing up to 6,000 rounds per minute. For its engines and performance, they are powered \nby two General Electric F110-GE-129C turbofan   engines, each producing 29,000 lb of thrust, \nthe F-15SG can exceed speeds of Mach 2.5 and   operate at altitudes up to 19,800 meters. It \nis capable of performing high-G maneuvers. Besides the F15SG and the F16, there \nis one more aircraft. But this time,   it is not one that was ordered years ago, but \none that is expected to come. It is going to   reshape the face of Singapore's air force, and \neven possibly the entire Southeast Asian region. In 2019, the Republic of Singapore selected the   F-35 as its next-generation fighter \njet. The following year, in 2020,   the United States government approved \nthe sale of the F-35B to Singapore. After approving the sale, the Singapore \ngovernment confirmed its order of 12 short   take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) capable \nF-35B Lightning II aircraft. In February of 2024,   however, Singapore’s Defence Minister Dr. Ng Eng \nHen announced the procurement of eight new F-35A   Lightning II 5th-generation fighter aircraft \nfor the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF),   with deliveries expected by 2030. This means \nthat the total F35 aircrafts will now be 20. The F-35A and F-35B Lightning II are \nexpected to replace the RSAF’s fleet   of F-16C/D Fighting Falcon fighters, which \nhave been in operation since the late 1990s,   and are set to begin retirement by the 2030s.  Singapore is the first country in Southeast \nAsia to acquire 5th-generation fighter aircraft,   maintaining the RSAF's status as the \nregion's most advanced air force. The F-35 is regarded as the “Most \nAdvanced Fighter Jet in the World”.   This was developed by no other than \nLockheed Martin. Lockheed even said on   its website that the F35 enhances national \nsecurity, strengthens global partnerships,   and drives economic growth. As the most \nlethal and connected fighter aircraft,   it provides pilots with a decisive advantage, \nensuring mission success and safe return. Now, you’ve understood just how capable \nand strong Singapore’s air force is!   Let’s compare these to its neighbors. \nLet’s first take a look at Indonesia. The only capable aircraft that one can compare \nSingapore to Indonesia is Indonesia’s own   Dassault Rafale. This is Indonesia’s newest \nfighter aircrafts. How does the Dassault   Rafale compare to the F-35 you may ask? Well, \nit is difficult to say how strong one aircraft   is to another. But the F-35 is known as an \nunmatched stealth, advanced sensor fusion,   and modern combat capabilities aircraft that \nmakes it highly effective for air dominance   and complex missions. The Rafale, while not \nstealthy, is highly versatile, cost-effective,   and capable of performing a wide range of \nmissions with advanced avionics and weaponry. In terms of cost, the F-35 is actually cheaper. \nAlthough variants, and data differ, according to   several sources the Dassault Rafale approximately \ncost 115 million dollars per unit, with an   operational cost of $16,500 per flight hour​. The \nF35A, on the other hand, costs about 80 million   per aircraft, and the F35B cost 115 million. Their \ncost per flight hour is about 36,000 dollars. Malaysia, on the other hand, is quite lagging \nbehind Singapore and Indonesia. They have a recent   contact with South Korea for the KAI T-50 Golden \nEagle. The KAI T-50 Golden Eagle is a supersonic   advanced trainer developed by Korea Aerospace \nIndustries (KAI) in collaboration with Lockheed   Martin. It can be used for pilot training, \nlight attack, and reconnaissance missions. The KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, however, cost a \nlot less than the Dassault Rafale and the   F35. Each unit cost approximately between \n30 to 35 million dollars. The KAI T-50,   therefore, is best suited for countries \nwith smaller budgets, and mostly used   for training and light combat roles. But in \nterms of combat, both are actually capable. Another Malaysian aircraft is the Sukhoi \nSu-30 which hails from Russia. The SU-30   is also regarded as a formidable aircraft. \nIt is the alternative choice to those seeking   aircrafts other than US companies. \nThey are a twin-engine multirole air   superiority aircraft that was developed by \nRussia's Sukhoi Design Bureau. Unfortunately,   Malaysia has been struggling maintaining \nits Su-30 aircraft fleet for years. In 2018,   it was reported that only four out of \ntheir 18 Su-30 fighters were able to fly. So, knowing these, does Singapore actually have \nsome of the best fighters in Southeast Asia? Well,   of course they do! But anyway, do let us \nknow what you think. Thanks for watching!", "duration(in seconds)": 548.0, "region": "US"}}

And I had about less than\na second left to live. Narrator: That's Lt. Col. Pete Smith, an Air Force veteran who spent his 28-year military career as a fighter pilot and has experienced an ejection firsthand. In TV and movies, a fighter pilot ejecting from their jet comes across as a cut-and-dry procedure. In reality, the process\nis complicated, violent, and leaves most pilots\nwith severe injuries. About 20% to 30% of fighter pilots experience some sort of\nspinal fracture as a result. But in most cases,\nejection-seat technology is the difference between life and death. So, how exactly does this technology work, and what is it like to\nexperience an ejection? It is a complex question. And as a matter of fact, the ejection seat's\nprobably the most complex piece of equipment within a fighter jet. As soon as you pull the\nhandle, at zero seconds, the first thing that's going to happen is you just send a signal to essentially start\nthe process of ejecting. Narrator: This handle, which sits between the pilot's legs, sends\nan electrical impulse to the aircraft to release the bolts holding the cockpit's canopy in place. A set of small rockets in the front then push the canopy up\nand out of the pilot's way. Then an explosive cartridge\nunderneath the seat goes off to catapult the\npilot out of the cockpit. This initiates the seat's rocket boosters, which propel the pilot\n100 to 200 feet upward. Sensors within the seat\nmeasure the plane's speed and the ambient air pressure to determine whether the pilot is at a low altitude and the parachute needs to\nbe deployed immediately, or whether they're at a higher altitude and the parachute needs to be delayed until they reach thicker air. In the latter case, the seat will still\ndeploy a smaller chute, known as a drogue, which\nhelps lower the pilot's rate of descent and stabilize the seat from careening into a deadly spin. Once the main parachute is deployed, a motor automatically fires, finally releasing the pilot from the seat. This entire process exerts 14 to 16 times the force of gravity on\nfighter pilots' bodies. If you have time to prepare,\nyou want to prepare. And the best thing to\ndo in preparation for ejecting out of one of these\nwith one of these seats is you want to be in position. And getting in position is\nto try and make yourself skinny and stiff and straight. Because you gotta remember, this thing's going to go up the rails. It's a catapult, and\nit's going to fire you up about 50 feet per second, and then a rocket's going to go off. And depending on where you\nare and what seat you're in, it's 5 to 20 g's going up those rails. And within two to four seconds, depending on what mode\nof flight you're in, you're going to have a full parachute. Once you're in a full chute,\nthe game's not over yet. Those are things that come\ninto the survival piece once you're in a chute. Am I in training? Am I in combat? And also in that is kind of an awareness of what you can expect. Am I in the Himalayas with\nmountains at 20,000 feet? I might have to do that\nman-seat separation on my own. Narrator: In 2007, Smith\nhad a harrowing experience while practicing a\nhigh-risk flight maneuver during training off the coast of Florida. So, essentially, I was low and high speed. I was spatially disoriented, we were fighting over the water at night, and I essentially had\nrolled this thing inverted and didn't even notice from\nthe visual cues outside that that's what happened to me. Passing 6,000 feet, I made\nthe decision to continue. We're supposed to get out\nif we're out of control at 6,000 feet, but I\ndecided to hang with it. And I'm trying to slow down, 'cause I was already through 600 knots. Narrator: That's an incredible speed. 600 knots is equivalent\nto 690 miles per hour. Smith: Essentially, if\nyou're above 500 knots, it's about a 90% fatality. Either you're going to get some kind of flailing injuries, or\nyou could snap the neck, or you can, there's lots of things that can go wrong at that high speed. The slower, the better. 180 knots is, like, the perfect speed. So I waited till about 2,000 feet, which is where I pulled the handle. And I had about less than\na second left to live. I went out around 400 miles an hour. And for me, what I will\nsay about any ejection, I don't care how slow or how fast or how, it's extremely violent. To this day, I can remember my body\nposition when I went out. Because it snapped me back to the right. It was taking the air out of my lungs. So [groaning]. It was like you fell out of a tree and got the wind knocked out of you type of thing. The whole thing was\nless than nine seconds, from recognition to in the water. For me, I was about 60 miles offshore, but it was pitch black out, and I couldn't even see my\nhand in front of my face. I did have injuries, but you don't know it because you have so much adrenaline pumping through your body. Narrator: It wasn't\nuntil after being rescued about an hour later by a Navy helicopter that Smith would discover\nhe had herniated disks in his neck and back as well as a torn ACL and MCL. Despite the physical dangers, advancements in technology have led to an average 90% survival rate in all types of ejections. And according to Smith, the most dangerous obstacle\nthat remains is hesitation. The one thing that can\nget in the way is this, you know, and that decision. Do I go now? Do I go later? Do I try to save the jet? That's where you get yourself in trouble. You just gotta know, and that's why we have these rules. You know, if something goes wrong, I can't hesitate. I gotta go. You've got to be willing\nto pull that handle. You know what I'm saying? And trust it.", "duration(in seconds)": 363.0, "region": "US"}}

million per unit and the USAF 6 generation fighter was estimated to cost around $300 million per unit yeah it's not cheap sixth generation fighter jet is expected to come out in the 2030s with a set of unique traits and features that have never before been seen it's expected to be optimized for range payload and stealth it will basically be fighting as a part of a highly integrated deep penetrating team of systems this will require it to have a set of features including a design that allows for stealth given the circumstances a slick design featuring an elongated Blended fuselage and Wing configuration without the traditional horizontal and vertical stabilizers seems like the best way to go it's also expected to be able to cover a lot more distance than previous fighter jets while holding its fuel internally beyond that it's expected to have the ability to sustain flight at supersonic speeds without using an After Burner which burns more fuel and increases Heat Signature it's important that the Enad fighter is data linked with assets over a broad area including collaborative combat aircraft and other drones based on information shared with the public so far it's expected that the Eng plane would control between one and five of these ccas it was stated in 2020 that the six gen fighter would likely have its own AI co-pilot with the advancements made in AI in recent years that doesn't seem like an impossibility anymore each of the drones acts as a multiplier in the air giving the man Fighter the ability to see farther shoot farther and engage more targets without putting more than one pilot in danger the ccas will basically be powered by Ai and come with tech like sensors Jammers and missiles increasing payload which we will touch on later the use of the ccas is not only C effective but also strategic as they will go a long way to improve survivability and expand the area where the six gen fighter can operate on its own without needing Beyond line of sight relays Like Satellites when this is combined with a highflying stealthy data Gateway system its connectivity can reach even further without depending on space-based resources when it comes to propulsion and power plant there's a huge effort underway with multiple contractors as part of what is called the next generation adaptive propulsion program or end gap for short the US Air Force awarded five contracts worth nearly $1 billion each to various companies like Boeing locked Martin and northr Grumman in August 2022 to work on end Gap additionally both pratton Whitney and General Electric were also given contracts for this project while the Air Force might have been thorough in its initial planning for the next gen fighter there are Technologies available now that were not available then that they plan to incorporate this includes onboard offensive and defensive lasers new advances in stealth and also new sensors for the fighter as a whole as exciting as these described features might be they are expensive and contribute to the Hefty price tag associated with the mass production of these sixth generation fighter jets while it sounds almost impossible we do have some ideas on how they can make it cheap but it does come with some compromise given how the six gen fighter is set up with the ccas it's been described as a family of systems the main fighter along with the ccas make up this family of systems while this does sound expensive it's actually considered coste effective and can be used to reduce the cost of developing the six gen fighter jet by Distributing its functions across the other ccas flying alongside it the six gen fighter could be the jet with a h human in it to serve as a line of sight to control the ccas and manage the Tactical operations using this approach will mean that the six gen fighter itself might not need its own radar and specialized sensors the systems such as the infrared search and track or irst electronic support measures and electronic warfare capabilities could be spread across modular ccas or other nearby platforms if it becomes necessary some of these could even be handled by space-based platforms or constellations with the data linked to the aircraft in real time this is risky as it will limit the main six gen fighter and make it very dependent on the ccas but it will also significantly reduce cost Beyond these the ccas could also be utilized as distributed payload platforms this is something we've seen aircraft like the X q67 offboard sensing station adopt we can even call it an early trial for such a system adopting that however will mean the six gen fighter will be less capable on its own in high combat scenarios such an approach will however be contrary to what the six gen fighter has always been thought to be that is heavy Interceptor like aircraft featuring a comparatively very large combat radius with an ability to carry a large payload of diverse Weaponry internally so that it can maintain its low observable or stealth abilities a reduction in the payload requirements for the six gen fighter would simply simplify its design and reduce the size of the platform this would significantly lower costs as everything from propulsion needs to the airframe size would be scaled down this doesn't necessarily mean that the fighter would be unarmed it could still carry a smaller weapons load out such as four a120 or a260 missiles along with two a9x side winders or four small diameter bombs or sdb for air to ground missions this setup would be sufficient for contingency and routine operations in less contested airspace like the Middle East where the ccas might not play a major role in regular missions where heavy payloads are needed the services of ccas or platforms like the B21 Raider could be utilized in deeper contested areas while F-15 EXs and B-52s could perform a similar role along the outer edge of high threat zones so instead of a heavily expensive six gen fighter a portion of those funds could be used to purchase additional b2s or F-15 EXs to support air dominance missions tied to the Eng Gad program anyone who is familiar with Air Force operations knows how much of a big factor fuel is if the six gen has anything like the features we mentioned earlier then fuel would have been a heavy and expensive headache it may have even needed a stealthy tanker that would operate at the edge of contested airspace if that's the case the USAF might have to build a stealth tanker and the need for for a much longer ranged sixth generation crew tactical jet could be offset to some degree the performance targets of the plane could also be revised it could be made a little slower and made to fly at lower altitudes than intended by easing up on Extreme or Cutting Edge performance requirements and avoiding the high costs associated with Advanced Materials and Technologies the Eng airframe could be made simpler and more affordable this will also mean scaling back the objectives of the Next Generation adaptive propulsion program a modified version of an existing engine or two would further reduce cost speaking of cutting down Innovations the laser Weaponry which was rumored to be a core component of the andad program could be taken out the weight volume complexity power generation and thermal management required to operate even a defensive laser system are substantial and expensive if compromises are being made in areas such as the airframe payload and performance capabilities this mismatch will become more evident and the remaining technological hurdles could pose serious obstacles for the program in simpler terms if the other breakthrough advances rumored to come with this fighter are going out then the laser must go as well so where does removing the advanced payload sensors and electronic warfare gear leave us for one we have a lighter and smaller aircraft but this leaves us with a mere shell of what we've always thought the six gen fighter would be sure the plane will be cheaper to produce but it loses a lot of its NextGen capabilities without its family of systems so while we've shown ways that the USAF could reduce the cost pertaining to the upcoming 6G fighter jets we hope they really don't if they want to remain at the top of their game and Innovation then sacrifices have to be made elsewhere Kendall stated in 2023 that they wanted a minimum of 200 NAD Fighters along with a th000 drone wingmen to accompany them into battle that's a lot of money and you can make it

very [Applause] [Music] tough so Donald Trump's trade war is well and truly underway he has spared no one this time not even India some observers had different expectations they believed that India would be left out because both sides are negotiating a trade agreement India and the US they've been talking about a trade deal Trump himself said this a few days ago so the Hope was that he won't impose tariffs till those talks conclude but that's not how it played out listen to this India very very tough very very tough the Prime Minister just left and he's a great friend of mine but I said you're a friend of mine but you're not be treating us right they charge us 52% you have to understand we charge them almost nothing for India is very tough he said he called Prime Minister Modi a great friend but he imposed tariffs nonetheless they will come into effect on the 9th of April and what's the rate 27% although Trump's chart as we just told you said 26% the official order of the US government says 27% and that chart had many such discrepancies but for the moment we'll focus on India what will be the impact of these tariffs on India how much would it cost the Indian economy $34 billion that's the cost that's almost 1% of India's GDP $34 billion 1% of India's GDP 0.9% to be precise and which Industries and sectors will be hit we have a list Electronics worth $14 billion Gems and Jewelry worth $9 billion and Automobiles and Auto Parts they will be charged a different rate though Trump has announced a blanket 25% tax on on automobiles and Auto Parts that's for all countries so the same 25% rate would apply to India too this is only for auto exports 25% tariffs and auto exports in India's case is not a substantial amount India does not export a lot of finished automobiles to the US but it does Supply Auto Parts and this export is worth $2.2 billion so broadly these are the industries that will be hit now let's talk about the ones that are safe Pharmaceuticals semiconductors and copper steel and Energy Products all these have been spared from the new Trump tariff regime and what is India's response the Commerce Ministry has issued a statement it said New Delhi is and I'm quoting carefully examining the tariffs it plans to take feedback from the industry there is one line that stands out in the statement let me quote the department is also studying the opportunities that may arise due to this new development now the use of the word opportunities is interesting how can India benefit from Trump's trade war is there a silver lining experts say there is look around the region other players have been slapped with far steeper tariffs like China effectively Chinese products will face 54% tariffs that's the highest among all us trade Partners Vietnam comes next with 46% tariffs overall then you have Bangladesh at 37% for India the Tariff is 27% it's still a blow but it could have been worse and this gap between India and its neighbors may work in India's favor specifically in three high value Industries textiles electronics and Machinery experts say that Trump's tariffs can open new doors for India one example they give is that of Taiwan it's the world the world leader in semiconductor Supply but if the supply chain shift from Taiwan and if India emerges as an alternative if it replaces Taiwan even partially it would be a boost for India's economy all of these are Big ifs but there's a possibility New Delhi can start with some low hanging fruits stuff like packaging testing and low-end Chip manufacturing so that's one scenario to harness the impending Supply disruption similarly India has opportunities in areas like machinery and toys China currently dominates the space but with tariffs as high as 54% businesses will look elsewhere to make their goods to cut costs and make maintain their bottom line so India is in a strong position but to leverage this India must reform India must position itself to win new businesses it must make structural reforms and offer compelling incentives to invite businesses this includes building infrastructure and strengthening the logistics Network there's a lot of work to do Trump's tariffs could push India towards making these changes at the same time India will have to manage Trump's unpredictability which brings us to the trade deal the US wants India to make sweeping concessions it wants to it wants India to reduce tariffs across the board from energy to defense and even agriculture now if India agrees to American terms it could still evade the tariffs but the price for this would be steep if you lower the barriers on American Goods Indian manufacturers could lose out if tariffs on Farm products are reduced Indian Farmers would protest and this is tricky both economically and politically so New Delhi will have to strike a tough balance greeting you with Aloha and Namaste now I I love India presents uh occupation of a territory by another country pertains to India what we saw in Kashmir the Prime Minister Modi how do you see Trump's America yes the current Administration behaves differently from the previous [Music] [Applause] administration are you saying that there are foreign powers who are trying to bring down the current government in Syria exactly blly Iran maybe Russia too Prime Minister Modi committed to our South South you know corporations for both not over 50 is Ukraine prepared to pay the price for that piece no compromises at the cost of territorial Integrity [Applause] [Music] only for", "duration(in seconds)": 466.0,

Bush \ndestroying Donald Trump's entire economic and   geopolitical perspective. This is from years \nago. This is not a new clip. And I want it to   be really clear. This is a rehabilitation of \nGeorge w. Bush. This is, not wasn't Bush great   war criminal helped lie the United States into \na war that killed hundreds of thousands. His   presidency was a disaster on multiple fronts. The \nreason I want to play this clip is that it's an   incredible reminder of the stark contrast between \nBush era Republicanism, which was bad enough,   by the way, which still understood some basic \neconomic principles and geopolitical strategy   and the complete and total collapse of rational \nthought under Donald Trump. So let's take a look   at the video and then we'll talk about\nWhat's interesting about our country,   if you study history, is that there are some isms \nthat occasionally pop up. One is isolationism and   it's evil twin protectionism and its evil triplet \nnativism. So if you studied the 20s, for example,   there was an American first policy that said who \ncares what happens in Europe. what happened in   europe mattered eventually because of world war \ntwo there was smooth holly which is a part of an   economic policy which basically said we don't want \ntrade now there was a slow-up barriers and there   was an immigration policy state during this period \nargued we had too many jews and too many italians   therefore we should have no immigrants and i \npoint to you is that we've been through this   kind of uh... period of isolationism protections \nand natives at native is I'm a little concerned   that we may be going through the same period.\nwhen George W. Bush starts to sound like the   adult in the room, you know, we've fallen very \nfar. Republicans used to understand that a   blanket tariff is bad for consumers. It's bad for \ntrade and it's bad for American jobs. They used   to at least pretend to care about alliances, \nabout global stability, about not blowing up   post world war two international order that flawed \nas it is, has helped to prevent some wars and   has also helped to sort of maintain the us as a \ncredible negotiating partner who doesn't just say,   I don't like this deal and I don' like that deal \nand we're not going to come to your defense even   though we agreed to, which is what we've seen \nunder the Trump era, which has just embarrassing   for the United States. You know, under Trump ism, \nit's tariff, everything who cares about Europe and   let's blow up global markets because it makes me \nfeel strong and it sort of placates my ego. It's   isolationism plus protectionism plus nativism. \nAnd that's really like a full package of economic   and diplomatic brain rot. And that the cocktail \nthat Bush was warning about and as disastrous   as Bush was, he sounds reasonable in this clip \ncompared to what's taken over his party. I'm not   saying Bush was a good president. Don't write to \nme saying, David, how can you say Bush was good   president. He wasn't a good president. The point \nhere is to show the contrast and how far things   have fallen. It used to be that we disagreed with \nRepublicans on policy, healthcare, taxes, labor   rights. Now we're in a world where the Republican \nParty doesn't even believe in basic economics or   facts or alliances or basic sanity. There used to \nsome bipartisan agreement that trade and diplomacy   and global cooperation our net positives. \nThere are negatives. You want to balance it,   but that they are net positives and that we \nbenefit as a country when we are connected to the   rest of the world rather than we want than when \nwe wall ourselves off from it. Now, there could be   disagreement about how should those relationships \nbe structured? Which deals were fair and which   deals were unfair? What industries do we want to \nprotect? Which industries don't we want protect?   But the idea that tariffs or taxes on Americans \ndidn't used to be controversial. In comes Trump,   turns it into a loyalty test. And suddenly \nany grasp of basic economics is considered   globalist treason. And there's a really deep irony \nhere. Trump's entire agenda is anti conservative   tariffs, massive government interference in the \nfree market, not a historically conservative   principle, blowing up alliances, risking military \nentanglements and economic collapse, using   emergency powers to bypass Congress. It's straight \nup authoritarian. There's nothing conservative   about it. and the people who spent decades warning \nabout big government are now cheering on a guy who   is using state power to micromanage international \ntrade like it's a vending machine. It doesn't make   any sense. There's no economic justification. The \ncracks are starting and tomorrow we will look at   Trump's approval hitting a new low. We will look \nthe Republican alliances that are looking to,   uh, uh fracture and interfere with what Donald \nTrump is doing. And this has the potential to   become a sort of silent civil war within the \nRepublican Party. Now on today's bonus show,   we will address that to a degree because house \nDemocrats have their own plan to force a vote on   killing Donald Trump's tariffs. And we want to \nsee where that lands. Eric Adams is bailing on   the Democratic Party because he couldn't win the \nDemocratic primary in the New York City mayoral   race if he ran in it. And he's saying, I'm going \nto be an independent now. We'll talk about whether   it will work. And we will also talk about should \nnew mothers be allowed to vote by proxy in the   House of Representatives? Seems like a simple. \nYes. Maga Mike Johnson says no.

It's also   about what's happening right now and what we \ncan still do to stop things from getting worse.   Trump's been back in power. The results have \nbeen even more catastrophic than many feared   with targeting of political opponents and gutting \ndemocratic institutions, laying the groundwork to   even further consolidate power. But the thing \nis that none of this is inevitable. The same   forces that brought us here can be countered if we \nunderstand how they and what to do about them. And   that's what the echo machine is all about. some \nsay that without corporate media backing books   like this can't succeed. I think we can prove them \nwrong.

Right. Joining us now with how the potential tariffs could impact the US economy. Former CFPB director Rohit Chopra and former Trump economic adviser Steve Moore. Once again, we've got a big old debate set up with two people that hate tariffs. This should be really great. Who who wants to start? Who hates him more? Rohit you probably hate him a little bit more. >> No. >> Actually. >> I'd say this. People want. >> A fair trading system. >> They don't want. >> Countries to cheat. And I think where I. Would focus on is why are we letting millions of small packages coming in with unsafe goods and even ingredients to make fentanyl go uninspected, and mostly from China? There's no question that there is unfair trading practices that really affect our workers and our businesses. But I think. >> People are a. >> Little bit confused. >> What's the. >> Fixation with Canada? And there are places where we want. >> To. >> Make sure we're protecting our workers and our businesses. But we've got to be focused on it and actually stop. >> Some of this stuff. >> From flowing onto our shores. And then on top of that. >> We really see. That there's. >> Some fine print in some of these trade deals that is actually helping Big pharma. Big tech companies and going against some US policies to lower drug prices. >> Steve. >> If could God if. >> If he can find some things he likes about tariffs you've got to be able to find something. What about what about reciprocal tariffs. Stephen Steve Moore who could not like reciprocal. If they're doing it to us, why can't we do it back to them. >> Well look, there's no question that Warren Buffett is right, that if. You just raise tariffs across the. >> Board. >> Then things will be more expensive. >> There's very little doubt about that. So Warren Buffett is right. But people forget that that isn't. >> The only thing. >> That Donald Trump is talking about. >> He also. >> Has. >> What I call. >> The UN tariff, which is. >> That he's. >> Saying that he may. >> Raise tariffs. >> To 15%. >> But he's also going to. >> Say if you if you manufacture. Something here in the United States. He's going to lower. >> The tax to 15%. So in other words, something. >> Made in, say, Dayton. >> Ohio or Charleston. South Carolina. >> Is going to. >> Cost less, but something coming in from. >> You know. >> China is going to cost more. >> So the effect of that is. >> Kind of neutral. >> Now I would. >> Make another point. >> That. >> Remember. >> Just last. >> Week we had a vote. >> In the United States House on whether we should. >> Have a $4 trillion tax increase, $4 trillion. It would be the largest tax increase. >> In the. >> History of the United States. And every single Democrat in the House voted for. >> A $4 billion. >> Tax increase. And yet these are the same people who say they're worried about inflation. I mean, imagine what that would do to costs of Americans if we walloped every family, every business with this giant tax hike. >> That doesn't the math doesn't necessarily make sense to me. Can you just sort of unpack that a little bit? I mean, if we're going to lower the tax on something made in Dayton, Ohio, the cost of labor, the cost of moving that manufacturing process here, the cost of having a manufacturing facility here will still be probably higher than 15%. Even if you lower a tax. >> Well. >> If you lower a. >> Tax, we just we just. >> Kind of establish this. If you lower. >> A. >> Tax, you're. >> Going to make things less expensive to produce. That's just. >> The. >> Inputs just are more economic. >> Inputs are much more. >> Well then why would the. >> Tariff not. >> Have I mean. >> A tariff is just a tax on things that come in from the United States. >> A reduction in the taxes. >> Here reduces the price of making things here. >> So what I'm. >> Saying is that you can't have a. Massive tax increase and not expect for that to have a big, big inflationary effect. And that's what Democrats I mean, you have to. >> Ask, you know, your other guests. >> Why is it Democrats would vote for $4 trillion tax increase if they're worried about prices? >> Well, Melissa, you're right that that math really is a. Little messy. What we're hearing, the truth. Is this. >> There is a need. >> For there to lower prices. And we have seen so many ways in which we can lower prices. I'm not really sure that's what's being focused on right now. >> We're seeing a focus. >> On Canada, where instead there might be issues around how to lower the cost of food and so many other goods. And of course, this. Issue about where the revenues from tariffs are going to go. Apparently it's just going to be in more corporate giveaways and giveaways to the wealthiest people. So I. >> Think we should. >> Go back to the basics and say. >> What is. >> The point of a trade policy? And we actually want a. Trading system where everyone is. Playing fair, where you're not sending in illegal chemicals to make fentanyl, that there's. Packages coming. >> In with. Goods made. >> Through illegal labor practices. And I. >> Think we got to. >> Focus on. That rather than the noise. >> And instead of. >> Not what families are trying to make hit their budget paycheck to paycheck. >> When. And I hear it all the time. Giveaways to the wealthy and giveaways to. Wealthy corporations. And I never really. I mean, do you really believe that. That corporations can just be grouped in with with the. >> Wealthy if you. >> Lower. >> The corporate tax. >> Rate to make U.S. Corporations more competitive and then they. >> You know, they succeed globally. >> And hire more people. And those people pay taxes. Don't those taxes that the employees pay don't they fund all the things the liberals and Democrats want to do? >> Don't they pay. >> All the federal employees that you don't want to get rid of any of them whatsoever? Why are corporations? >> Why is. It bad to allow. >> Corporations to have the. >> Best shot. >> They can at success? >> Of course. >> That's that's not that's. >> Not the. But you call it corporate giveaway. >> Corporate giveaways. >> What is that? What I'm saying is that. Well, let's talk about that. There is sometimes in tax deals and in trade deals, fine print that is allowing. >> Them really special favors. Look at. >> Some of the older trade. Deals that put. Into place fine print for pharma companies. >> That was in. >> Direct contradiction to some of the efforts to get more generic pharmaceuticals in. >> Look at what is happening with some of the trade. >> Deals around. >> Big tech companies. >> Direct contravention to what we are trying to do. >> To. >> Foster more startups and more competition. >> And so we've. >> Seen this over the past 20 years. And often it gets distorted by special interests. Rather than thinking broadly about what's the way to grow the economy. >> Hold on. >> You hear it all. You hear. >> It all the time, don't you, Richard? >> Yeah. >> Look, billionaires and corporations. >> Yeah. First of all, let's be clear. >> I work for Donald. >> Trump in his first term. >> I worked. >> For Joe Biden under under Donald Trump. We had a 1.95% inflation rate under under Joe Biden, the inflation rate was 3 to 4 times higher than that. So we actually conquered inflation. Inflation went up to 9% when Biden was president. So why would anybody, you know, if you're going to do all these wonderful things to reduce inflation and there's. >> All these ideas. >> Out there, why didn't the Biden administration do them? Why did they allow prices to go through the roof? The other point I want to make is they keep talking about tax cuts for the rich and on so on. The rich pay more a larger share of taxes than any time today than in in history. And you're talking about a tax bill that a tax hike that Democrats voted for every one in the House that would raise the tax on the average family by $3,000. I'm sorry. I don't understand how that's going to reduce inflation. Also, don't forget virtually every small business in America got a 20% reduction in their in their tax. How is how is raising that tax back up going to reduce inflation. So job number one is to get the tax cut done. So we don't have this giant tax increase. And then we can we look we can have tariffs. But we have to make sure they're offset by other tax policies that that benefit domestic producers. Things that are made in the USA. I mean why would we tax something c", "duration(in seconds)": 512.0, "region": "US"}}

Francisco home to the annual Games Developers Conference GDC as it's known isn't like other game shows it's not really about showing off new games I think every type of developers here you know whether you're a writer whether you're working in narrative design game design level design and this is the one chance that everyone can get together Trends come and go in video games And the big one this year is everywhere you look on the expo floor There's an AI solution to this or an AI solution to that But the big question is what difference will all of this AI make to the games that we actually play ai's presence is being felt in a number of different ways from tools that allow developers to create elements of video game worlds just by using text prompts Forgotten your own company have you no No I'm I'm with Fazbear Financial Interesting Because I could swear you told me Emberstone Enterprises before to in-game characters that react in a more realistic way to the player Bloom says you're the one to help us tweak the plan And AI and gaming particularly relates to how AI could improve gamers experience by helping them play the games or how it could enable developers to make games faster and cheaper There's definitely a tension and firstly it's around jobs uh where you know AI could take uh developers jobs and secondly around training data Where is the AI getting all the stuff that it uses to be able to generate say uh a new skin or a new uh character outfit and if you imagine uh the traditional game developer in the middle they're squeezed by AI on one side the robots making stuff and user generated content on the other the people making stuff So this traditional game development is going through a very challenging time Bravo 2 lead the way Copy One company embracing AI is Chinese tech behemoth Tencent It's introduced an in-game assistant called Backle or first FPS AI companion who understands human language That trips off the tongue in position The AI companion will be introduced into firsterson shooter Arena Breakout Its developers say unlike regular in-game teammates this one can understand complex spoken instructions Run to those sandbags up front for cover then to the car ahead Copy that I think in the future we can put this tech in maybe open world RPGs So imagine you can walk around the city and talk to everybody by using natural language Search for a green box Copy that We'll find out if this AI makes a good teammate when the feature launches later this year Found it The GDC show floor is packed with indie developers with out of the ordinary ideas for games and ways of controlling them Stand up Stand up Stand up Including patting a giant kitty Umbrellas as controllers as well as seesaws And they're not alone Keyboard and mouse game pad These are the things that we use to control video games Anybody that's played a game will be familiar with them But what about if there was a different method of interacting with the action on the screen that's what this band on my wrist is doing It's fitted with a variety of different sensors which are measuring my emotions It actually has more sensors in it than you would find in a smartwatch The onscreen action will alter depending on how I feel Now this is a horror game demo What happens if I get frightened called Oroide It can be used to create a relaxing experience or as we see here something designed to do the opposite And I can see the emotions that I'm feeling on this screen here Spooky doors Oh mannequin Okay he's not doing anything An even creepier factory space Whoa If you want to survive stay calm If I don't want this mannequin to get me I've got to try and calm down And there's another one here Okay I'm going to make a run for it Let's go for the door Open Open Open On top of heart rate and skin temperature the band measures galvanic skin response which its developers say allows it to assess the emotional state of the player Combining this with generative AI changing gameplay elements based on how the player is feeling could lead to new types of player experience Because the idea is to be able in the near future to have a really uh ultra personalized game that only measure your emotion and adapt itself depending on what the game design is If they want to stress you more or they want or the designer wants to relax or maintain you in a certain level of spectrum of emotions The band is currently being pitched to developers The breadth of creativity on show at GDC 2025 demonstrates that even in the age of AI the industry is still

America has given us an\nunprecedented and powerful mandate. On the campaign trail, he\noffered many ideas for the future. Other countries are going to\nfinally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we've\ndone for the world. We will drill, baby, drill. In reality, President Trump\nhas quite a great deal of discretion on how he acts,\nespecially with a with a Republican Congress. I don't think this is just\ngoing to be a magic wish list of everything that Trump\nwants. So what's in store now that\nAmericans have cast their vote? Many Americans voted\nwith their wallets in this election. Consumer prices\nhave increased over 20% since February 2020. I bet most Americans under the\nage of 45 or 50 have never experienced inflation until\nthis last episode, and I don't think they realized that\nwould basically take a recession, you know, even a\ndepression in the United States to restore the price\nlevel to what it was in 2019. Managing prices in the United\nStates is typically left to the Federal Reserve. The Fed's policies affect the\ncost of borrowing money, which in turn influences how likely\nyou are to get a job or afford rent. President Trump may\nlook for more control there. I made a lot of money. I was very successful, and I\nthink I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people\nthat would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman. To politicize Central bank is generally\nassociated with higher rates of inflation, and it ends up\nhurting the US and actually ends up benefiting the rest\nof the world because you essentially get capital\noutflow from the United States. Trump getting involved with\nthe Fed will certainly spook people and investors to a\ncertain extent. Wouldn't surprise me if you\nsee the replacement in 2026 when Powell's term as Chair\nis up. Trump has other tools to help\nAmericans out financially. One idea called for leaving\nabout 93 million Americans off the hook for at least a\nportion of their federal income taxes. I think when h\ne proposed eliminating the income tax and just having\ntariffs, there was sort of like an oh my gosh moment for\neveryone. We've seen this with Trump\nbefore, right? He throws out this really\nbold idea. But then by the time it\nactually starts being implemented, by the time he's\ntalked with more people about it, you see it kind of\ntransform. Americans received a tax cut\nduring Trump's first term, but that tax cut is set to expire\nin 2025. I think Republicans pretty\nmuch across the board do want to see a lot of what was in\nthat 2017 tax package expanded. To pay for those cuts congress\nwill have to shuffle things around. They may consider\nending the tax exempt status for municipal bonds, or dial\nback health care spending. Without cuts it could add to\nthe national debt. When you saw this passed in\n2017, it really did add to the deficit and there is a chance\nthat it could do so again. By 2030 Federal debt could\namount to over 125% of gross domestic product, or GDP,\nwhich is a measure of the country's entire economic\noutput. Another option increase\neconomic growth by loosening regulations that impact\nindustries like oil production, airlines, banking\nand tech. Deregulatory process is\nsomething that probably will be pointed to as the most\npotential influence. You know, the economy is so\nmany things in so many places that's open to so many\nforeign influences that the extent to which Trump alone\nand his White House alone can shape that, I think is often\noverstated. Trump has also called for\ntariffs of 10 to 20% on imports arriving in the\nUnited States, and a higher tariff on Chinese goods. The higher the tariff, the\nmore likely it is that the company will come into the\nUnited States and build a factory in the United States,\nso it doesn't have to pay the tariff. The goal of those tariffs is\nto generate revenue and bring industrial jobs back to the\nUnited States. Ironically, this would not\npromote a revitalization of the industrial sector. Those sorts of things will\nraise the prices of all kinds of industrial inputs. And so that will make it\nharder to produce industrial products in the United\nStates. It will also tend to push\ndown investment. Those tariffs could also lead\nto higher prices for shoppers. The impact on different levels\nof household income is pretty dramatic. And you know, these\nkinds of taxes, tariff taxes are extraordinarily\nregressive and hurt lowest income families the most. The tariff policy is expected\nto weigh on both small and big businesses. The\nPresident-elect's promise to deport undocumented people\ncould have a far reaching economic impact. On day one, I will launch the\nlargest deportation program in American history. There's estimated 8.3 million\nundocumented workers in the United States right now. If you pull them, any\nsubstantial number of them out, it will have large\nnegative effects on the US economy. If all undocumented workers\nwere expelled, employment would fall below its baseline\ntrend by 2028. Economic growth would\ndecline to. Agriculture and construction\nwould be particularly hard hit. Food prices in the\nUnited States would go up substantially, and it would\nsubstantially disrupt the housing market. They provide a reservoir of\nrelatively low cost labor that is a kind of lubricant to how\nthe economy works.", "duration(in seconds)": 368.0, "region": "US"}}

Coming off the jobless claims number. We're going to pivot now the conversation to talk about the labor market impact of the government's Doge cost cutting initiatives. The Trump administration has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. Many will likely be eligible for federally funded unemployment benefits, as well as other assistance like food stamps and Medicaid. Joining us now, Diana Furchtgott-roth, former chief economist of the Department of Labor, and, Diana, at this point, can we know anything, the numbers. And every time we have an employment report, we hear that the way you arrive at the net, plus or minus, we're talking millions and millions of jobs. Is this can this actually play into to labor market figures what's happening with Doge? >> Well. >> It certainly can. When people are laid off and they look for jobs, then those are in the employment data. So yes. >> But it's just. >> As when there. >> Are no. >> Layoffs. >> It's thousands, not millions. >> It's thousands. >> At the moment. Yes, yes, exactly. >> So it seems like it. So it will play into it. But would we notice it in the actual numbers. Is it large enough to where it could skew the numbers one way or the other? >> We're not going to notice it. In the monthly figures. Published by the Bureau of Labor. >> Statistics. >> We might notice it, as you were saying, in certain areas, in certain districts like Maryland, Virginia, District of Columbia, but in the aggregate numbers for the whole nation that are released on the first Friday, we probably will not notice it. >> I That'si Stephenson from the University of Michigan is now also joining us. What could the impact be in your view, Betsy? >> Well, I mean, first of all, we obviously won't see it in the next employment report because these layoffs. >> Happened very smartly. >> Right after the reference week. >> That's a very. >> Clever way to try to keep these. Things out. >> Of the. >> Out of those monthly. Reports we see, because as long as. People find a job before the next month's reference, week before the week of March, that March 12th, that contains the 12th, they won't show up at all. So a lot of these people may spend a couple of weeks unemployed. >> But find a. >> Job by then. So even if the numbers were big enough to show up, there's a little bit of a runway for people to try to find work before it would actually show up in the data. I do think that these numbers, you know, if you look at the number of people who are laid off every month, it's not really big enough to show up. But I don't think that's that captures the full impact. You know, a lot of people pointed out just how many people, you know, we have 5 million people lose a job every month. This is small compared to that, except for. Most of those people who lose a job, they're not actually losing it. They're quitting. They're planning to leave. They have a plan for what they're doing next. I think a lot of these federal workers were absolutely blindsided, and that's going to change their behavior. I also think that there is a chill in the air about who might lose their job next, and that can start to reduce spending. I in fact, I would recommend to my friends, cut your spending now build your nest egg. We don't know what's going to happen. There's a lot of uncertainty whenever you're in an economy where a lot of people feel they need to build their nest egg, cut back their spending, you start to see the economy slow. >> Steve. Are you you're still with us, Steve Liesman. >> Yeah. I'm here. Joe. >> I don't know whether you want to weigh in further on that. I had a question to ask you about something a little bit different, Steve, and it has to do with you remember how the second round of stimulus checks we thought of might have added to demand, which might have added to inflation? I'm getting I'm getting some pushback on Twitter and elsewhere about whether a $5,000 Doge check would be inflationary. Some say that if it goes back to people that they they bank it in savings, and anything not spent by the government would not be inflationary. And it's already been created by the fed. So it's not adding to the money supply, but it just seems to me that it might increase demand in an already strong economy. Do you have a feel for whether it's inflationary? >> Yeah, I think it's an interesting question, Joe. And I think there's a mathematical equation here. And there's a psychological equation. The mathematical one is well, technically if you're taking 5000, that was going to be spent by the government and give it to people to spend. It's kind of a wash in terms of total demand. But you're moving the demand from one place to another, from the demand for government services to, say, demand for consumer products. So there could be a bump there. All of that is kind of like a rounding error. On the concern about the psychological impact. Joe, this is why it's a great question you ask, because this is why the tariff issue is a different issue now from when it was in 2018. You're just coming off of a bout of high inflation. You still have inflation above trend or above where the target is. So when you start doing things like that, it could foment another psychological round of concern about inflation getting going. People start to get this idea, hey, prices are rising. So you want to be concerned about about that. It might be something the administration might be a little careful about in terms of dumping $5,000 into the pockets. Obviously everybody's all for it. Let me just say one more thing, Joe, if I could about the layoffs, you can feel any way you want about whether or not this should be done, but but I think there's a human aspect to this that I think is unnecessary. There are people who move to Washington or moved into or quit a job. I would like to think that it could be done. Joe. More humanely, that gets around. It doesn't address the issue of the numbers. They're not showing up in the jobless claims. Hopefully these folks get a job, get a job very quickly, but I don't think there was any reason for this kind of the process by which these folks have been laid off, who quit their jobs, moved from their cities to come work and do service for the federal government. I think there's a dignity and human aspect that we shouldn't forget here. And by the way, it's not just in the Delmarva area. It's going to be all around the country where these federal workers are. >> Right. >> Okay. >> Can I just ask you one question, which is if you were to take that money that would otherwise be sent, potentially as a dividend refund, check whatever you want to call it to the public and pay down the debt. Would it have any impact, do you think, on the ten year note? >> I do, I do, and I have maintained for a long time, Andrew, because the government doesn't have necessarily an issue of repaying its debt. It's got an issue of the will to repay the debt. That's the reason why these agencies have downgraded the U.S. Government. And it also has an issue, essentially, of the trajectory of the deficit. I think the bond market is hungry for and would react very positively to a sense that this administration is serious about bringing down the deficit, serious about putting the deficit on a sustainable trajectory. So if they did that, I think that would be positive and would probably have an outsized effect beyond what they were actually paying down. >> All right. >> Right. >> And if I could add to that. >> Yeah, go ahead. >> And if I could add to that, the difficult part for Doge is not the federal workers, it's the entitlements and all the massive spending that comes from that. And the question. >> Is. >> If you're going to deliver medical care benefits, how can you do that at a lower cost? If you're going to deliver defense, how can you do that at a lower cost without cutting the overall level of the quality that yo", "duration(in seconds)": 491.0, "region": "US"}}

I honestly think there's nothing more powerful than send you the dream that you can be like them if you don't because if the poor listen you ever watch any of those Bruce Lee kung fu movies, what does he do? Goes into a room, fights 100 guys one at a [ __ ] time, right? They come in one at a [ __ ] time. Listen, these guys are [ __ ] rich, right? If we fight oneon-one, they'll take everything. And if the poor are selfish, trying to fight one at a time, running at Bruce Lee, one at a [ __ ] time, then they'll get taken out one at a time. And I think if you turned around tomorrow and said 90% 90% tax, 90% inheritance tax, everyone with the amount of money to leave the country would leave the country and then you would end up in a country with no super wealthy. Yeah. Well, I want to be clear. I I I don't think a 95% income tax is probably the right choice. Especially if you made it 60, I think a lot of people I think actually even now with this the changes Labour have made. A lot of people are looking at Dubai, looking at the south of France, Monaco, therefore a huge amount of tax leaves the country. For me, it's about raising taxes on wealth. These rich families are sitting on enormous amounts of wealth, right? So say we turn around to and I want to make it clear what this wealth is. This is assets. Yeah. This is this is property. This is buildings. This is mortgages. This is your mortgage. This is government debt. Right? If I own 100 million pounds of British mortgages and I move to the Cayman Islands, where's my money coming from? The UK. British people paying their mortgage. And we can choose to tax it. Listen, I guarantee you the government of China would not allow me to own a 100 million pounds of Chinese assets, live in the Cayman Islands, and pay no tax. They wouldn't. Why does the British government allow it? Why does the British government, whose recent prime minister was worth £700 million and whose father-in-law was one of the richest men in the world, allow rich people to not pay tax just by pretending to live in Dubai? You will tell us because the because the politicians are super rich. What can we do right now to change the game for them? I think the only thing that stops it, what I will say is there's no economic fail safe. the more assets that they have and the less assets that you have, the more you have to pay them to do things like live in a house, to to get energy, to eat food, right? So that the cash flows it's it's it's accelerating, right? Because they get richer, you're paying more interest, which means they get even richer. If you don't watch inequality and you let it get bigger and bigger and bigger, that is not immaterial to you. That is why your kids won't be able to get a house. That is why your kids will live in poverty. And and I say poverty, I don't say that lightly. You know what has happened in the last 5 years in this country and it's happened in a lot of other countries as well. This is a real significant material increase in poverty and not just for the bottom 10% not just for the bottom 20%. Half the country now struggle to simultaneously turn the heating on and feed their kids in the winter. And that's new and the message I want to give you and give your audience is that's not going to get better because inequality is still getting worse at a rapid rate. And we need to do something if we want to stop that from happening. Where we have some hope and where we basically have some power and we have to exercise it is the politics. 150 years ago your average British person lived in abject poverty and we got out of it. And we got out of it because people got together after World War II and said, \"Listen, we've just spent the last six years devoting our entire economy to [ __ ] killing each other.\" And in that time, we were still able to provide people in our countries with education, health care, housing, food. Well, we're not [ __ ] letting go of that. We demand education, housing, healthcare, food. And what did they do? They raised the top rate of income tax to 95%. They raise inheritance tax to 90%. And what happens? Suddenly, [ __ ] lo and behold, ordinary people get good quality housing and good quality education and good quality healthcare. And people like my dad work for the post office and support a family. You know, we've done it before. So, it's not impossible, but it requires working together. And it's the last time it took two [ __ ] world wars, and I don't want that to happen again. Do you think it could get that bad in Western society? I think it will get that bad. I think here's the truth. Your body is like an engine, and you need to keep it at its best day in day out. I mean, think of it this way. You wouldn't fuel a racing car on cheap fuel. So, why are you doing similar to your body? I take heights vitals. I take them every single day. They stop me feeling run down, sluggish. I used to have brain fog. Not anymore. Two small capsules. These act as my premium grade fuel. I'm keeping with the racing metaphor. So, vitals are a blend of vitamins, nutrients, minerals, omega-3, all the bees. Basically, everything you need to perform at your best. So, if you're looking for something that keeps you in the driving seat with your nutrition, your brain, and body health, then this is it.

To protect your middle class, you need to stop the rich from growing and growing and growing their wealth because eventually they eat your wealth. You know, it's it's these things are connected. But at the moment, the story we have about what is a a rich economy, what is a wealthy economy is about individualism, is about entrepreneurism. It is about every man for himself. And I think there are good sides to this. But the fact is the only power the poor and the ordinary working people have ever had to protect themselves and the rich is power in numbers. And when you make ordinary people extremely individualistic, they lose that. Listen, I've got a YouTube channel that says very clearly, listen, your kids and your grandkids are going to live in really bad poverty. And the only way to stop that is to fight together to tax the rich more. I've been doing that for years. And uh the number one most common comment I get on the YouTube channel by a million miles. Do you want to guess what it is? How do I make more money? How do I make more money? I'm not against, you know, one person going out, I'm going to make money. I'm going to get rich for me and my family. I'm not against that. But we send this message out like success is all about what you put in when in reality success in today's society and you know we're a bit older than the kids today. Success in today's society for the younger generations is 90% dad. I'm I'm sorry to say that but it is. And of course there's a 10% which you put in but it's 90% dad. So how do you feel when you see all these hustle culture Instagram accounts, hustle culture podcasts, work harder than everyone else, take bigger risks than everybody else? feel [ __ ] sad because I because I know what that does to the mental health of young men. To tell them to listen, we live in a society and a culture that very often tells young men, you are what you make. That is your value. If you don't make money, you are worthless. Um, and if you don't make money, it's because you didn't hustle hard enough. You need to work harder. We send that message to young men in a society which makes it increasingly extremely difficult, bordering on impossible to make money. What What is it going to do to the mental health of young men to simultaneously tell them you're worthless if you don't make money, the amount of money that you make is based on how hard you work and make it impossible for them to make money? And then how can you then be surprised when you see the growth of Andrew Tay and the growth of Donald Trump? These people are [ __ ] angry because we [ __ ] lied to them. Tell them the truth. Tell them the truth, which is, listen, we, your elder generation, [ __ ] it and gave you almost no chance and you need to work super super [ __ ] hard just to pay the kids. And if you do that, if you work hard and you feed your kids and you put a roof over the over their heads, be [ __ ] proud because we made it hard for you. Tell them the truth. Tell them the truth. And then they should be proud of themselves. They should be proud of themselves because it's hard nowadays to have a family.", "duration(in seconds)": 493.0, "region": "US"}}
